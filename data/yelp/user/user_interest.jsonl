As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ri de to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \n\nAlthough that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that.

To my surprise and excitement, Ekta showed up 10 mins early. I loved them already.\n\nAfter one bite of the goan shrimp curry, I immediately knew that Ekta was my new spot. First off the sauce was great. It had kick, but not too much and finished with the perfect hint of coconut. The shrimp were also cooked to perfection. Then, tried the butter chicken. The sauce was packed with flavor and hints of heat and the chicken was also cooked perfectly. I find that my biggest issue with Indian takeout  tends to be that the food can be over cooked but Ekta did great. Both the shrimp and the chicken were perfect and I was happy.

I really loved the location of this hotel. It was walking distance to nearly everything Philly had to offer. We're pretty much in between the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Reading Terminal. So you can walk one direction towards the Museum  and go through Ben Franklin Parkway and through the Rodin Museum and near towards Eastern State Penitentiary or towards Reading Terminal which will lead you close to the Liberty Bell and other touristy sites.\n\nUpon arrival, we had the valet take our car. They offer a in and out service which was very convenient for us. It allowed us to take the car out at night and see some the sites and hit up Pat's Steaks. The checking in process here is a breeze. The concierge was really friendly and helpful. There were a few things I disliked about the hotel. One would have to be their elevators. They have 3 elevators but they were all so slow! My second was their bathroom. The toilet seat was loose and the sink counter and cabinet below was dirty. I had to wipe everything down with disinfectant wipes. Everything else was pretty spot on. The beds were a bit small but it was bearable. The rooftop pool was nothing luxurious but for what it is, it worked. It wasn't crowded, they had fresh towels on hand and plenty of seating. Beverages weren't allowed at the pool site. The views were pretty nice.\n\nVerdict - I would definitely come back to Windsor Suites if I were to visit Philly again in the future.

There is an extreme lack of seasoning or flavor of any kind in any of the dishes I tried, which included the appetizer ribs and bacon dishes, the steak entree, the peanut butter mousse french toast, breakfast bacon (which was chewy, not at all crispy), and the pancakes.  Plus, the beneits were raw inside, as was the french toast, despite being crisp almost to the point of being burnt on the outside.  And I'm not talking about a little undercooked - you could pull the dough several inches if you were so inclined.\n\nThe server on Sunday was more interested in selling drinks to increase the size of the check than in making sure we were happy with our meals.  One person ordered the \"veggie burger\", which should not be listed as a burger at all.  It's a bunch of chopped vegetables wrapped inside chewy burnt slices of eggplant.

The server made a point of asking me if I enjoyed my dish, as I had finished it, but then took my friends almost full plate without bothering to ask how hers was. The drinks were also inconsistent.  One person ordered the cherry gimlet and got hers served correctly in a martini glass.  Mine came loaded with ice in the same glass I had just finished drinking a different drink in; after the first couple of sips, all I tasted was water that melted from the ice.\n\nThen, 2 of our party wanted to use credit cards, while the rest of us used cash to cover our share of the food/tax/tip.  We specifically asked to have a certain dollar amount applied to each card, but instead, the airheaded waitress applied all the cash to the check and split the balance on the cards, leaving everyone confused.  She acted like she was doing us a favor by giving us a copy of the original check so we could figure it all out again.  Without exception, restaurants have typically applied cash last, not first.

I should have gone for, and I will recommend others in the future to find another rental company such as Hertz, at which you can always find codes to waive this crazy fee.\n\nThe last thing is DO NOT buy the fuel option. Although it claims $1.99 per gallon, this is before tax. You will find the price after tax to be very closed to what you can find outside. And, you will NEVER return the car on empty. This is nothing good but a trick for rental companies to steal 3- to 4-gallon sales from you.\n\n\n*** Final note:\nNot about this location but where I returned my car.\n\n\"Return Location Address and Phone Number :\nPORT JEFFERSON STATION\n320 ROUTE 112\nPORT JEFFERSON STATION, NY 11776-1010\nTel.: (631) 474-2100\"\n\nThis address is totally WRONG!!!

About 20 minutes into our wait, the first group of four was escorted to their table.\n\nFollowing the first group's seating, no fewer than five other groups of four or five people, all of whom requested a table after we had already requested ours, were seated. The \"back five\" of our group waited more than an hour for a table that they would never be offered. Furious, they left for 24-hour McDonalds breakfast instead -- a decidedly less exciting option than the Sabrina's menu, but their only choice in this environment. \n\nAs an added bonus, the people in charge of taking names and finding seats ignored our other group's request for seating and declined to provide clarification on why they had not been seated after an hour, and basically wrote off their business.

Stay out.\nNo quick seating here\n\nI've got to get something out from the outset: for god sake (okay mainly my sake), if you don't like whiskey don't go here and take up a seat that would better serve someone who is functionally literate and can read the sign on the door.\n\nAnd here's why: 57 American Mashbill Bourbons, 14 Ryes, 44 Single malts, 13 Irish Whiskeys and 13 blended offerings, as well as a cocktail menu separated into prohibition and repeal era drinks. I ordered only off the established menu, but my bet is you can pretty much order any drink you want here with the knowledge that it will be excellent. They have beer, but there's no reason for that foolishness when there's enough whiskey to drown Delaware on hand.\n\nWith no reservations aside from walk-up and wait, we took our first round standing along the window counter. The counter and bar is open seating, so we snagged two end seats after circling like buzzards. The whole interior is solid, with tile floors and marble counters. The tiling blends well with the wood of the bar and leather of the seating areas, as if someone decided to stuff a speakeasy into the prep kitchen in a Newport mansion basement.\n\nFor the sake of organization, the spirits and dinner were:\n\nRound 1 - Sazarac - A great looking rye drink, and perfect opening salvo to the evening. The sweetness of the sugar mixes well with the tang of bitters and the citrus of the lemon peel.\n\nRound 2 - De Rigueur - Another rye, but you wouldn't know it from the color. The harsh rye blends well with the sweet aperol, and the citrus tang is balanced by the sugary honey. Looks like a 'ladies drink' but it'll knock you back.\n\nRound 3 - Bakers 7 year - Skip desert, get a whiskey. I tried for the Evan Williams Single Barrel, but barring that reverted to a favorite. Bakers is harsh and I always enjoy it on the rocks, letting the water open up the sweeter flavors beneath the first bite.\n\nAnd of course, drinking on an empty stomach is never a good idea. Village has a small menu, but pretty much just what you'd need, with a good range of prices. Consumed this evening was:\n\nAppetizer - The Cheese Puffs are so dainty, and are a good dish for sharing. The cheese is melted right in to the dough, and they come oh so close to completely melting in your mouth.\n\nMain course - Village Burger with onions and bleu cheese. For the quality, I would have paid a good bit more for this burger. Of course, all the toppings are a la carte, so if you have a big taste that evening, it could get pricey.

They do a decent draft list, as well as a few cocktails and glasses of wine from the menu. The tap list won't blow you away, but everyone in any size group will find something suitable.\n\nThe menu changes pretty regularly, but the burgers and pub fare are stalwarts. And delicious.

I loved the look of it from the brightly painted outside to the warmly painted cozy inside with hammered copper tabletops. \n\nThe place is pretty small and it was packed when we got there, but were able to snag a free table off in the corner.  I started out with the cafe con chocolate.  I figured a beverage must be pretty spectacular to name a restaurant after it...and it was! A big steamy mug of hot chocolate with a shot of espresso was exactly what I needed. Then came the food.  After what seemed like an eternity I was presented with a big delicious mess of a plate.  The Chilaquiles with mole sauce and scrambled eggs was delectable...and huge.  I sampled my friend's huevos rancheros which was also quite tasty.  We also shared a side of plantains (sweet fried deliciousness topped with cream and cheese) and home fries (perfectly fried and spiced with what I believe was chipotle).  \n\nI was STUFFED by the end of this meal.  Portions are gigantic.  We had to utilize the table next to us for our sides of plantains & home fries because the main dishes took up our whole table. Despite my gluttonous state of brunch overload, I couldn't help but notice the nachos being served to the next table over.  Damn, they looked good.  I can't wait to go back to this place and try out more menu items!", "p": ["Mexican", "Restaurants", "Coffee & Tea", "Cafes", "Food", "Breakfast & Brunch"], "n": []}, {"business_id": "fEqiXG_B-fn__w0aeF3nBQ", "name": "Laurel", "date": "2014-04-26 15:26:31", "stars": 5.0, "text": "I finally made it to Laurel the other night and it exceeded my expectations. Service was perfect: personable and friendly yet professional and knowledgeable. To start I had the torn scallops which were bright & refreshing.  I sampled the albacore tuna which I actually preferred over the scallops.  Next up were the gnocchi. WOW, absolute BEST gnocchi I've ever had, hands down (actually, one of the best things that I've ever eaten overall).  They were so good that I tried to eat them as slowly as possible to prolong the deliciousness.  They were pillowy perfection.  For the 3rd course I chose the beef (brought to the table by Chef Nick Elmi himself!) and it too was delicious.  For dessert I had the white chocolate pudding which was described by our server as kind of a play on cereal & milk.  Well, it was the tastiest \"cereal\" I've ever had.  It too was a dish that I ate as slowly as possible, savoring each bite.  When dinner was over, my friend pretty much summed it up when she said \"I'm sad it's over!\".  We were only half joking when we said we wanted to order more gnocchi.\n\nI'm glad I made that reservation when I did since Laurel is pretty well booked up months into the future.

I told them that I wanted them hemmed to wear with flats.  They did this SAME DAY on a Saturday! I recently went in again and said 'I want these exact jeans that I'm wearing but in a different wash'.  The sales associate didn't even ask questions.  She said 'ok so those are the Sebastian McCall straight leg, here are our other washes'.  Smooth & efficient.

Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.\nBut whats this? \nThere are whispers that he no longer cooks for \"Best Taste of Asia,\" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.\n\nNo.\nNo, it can't be! \nI need to score - one .. final .. hit..\n\nLife ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?\nWhy am I here?\nWhat is Cheeze Wiz?\nIts done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.\n\nZaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entrées like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. \n\nZaika 's appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.\n \nI've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don't mind at all.\n\nThe menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.\nThough some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. \nThe head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.\n\nI have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.\n\nThe bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for \"Best taste of Asia,\" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. \n\nOnly good things can come of this, only good things.\n\nP.S.\nZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. \nHowever, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available.

The chinks in that well polished armor Square 1682 sports became apparent as the evening wore on. Lets begin where the meal ended, shall we?\n \nNo one likes to have the last impression of a restaurant to be poor. Sadly, this was exactly the case at Square 1682. Nearly every dessert on the restaurant week pre-fixed menu fell short in some small way. Be it ice crystals in the gelato, a pet-peeve of one of my dining associates, to the Caffe con Leche Panna Cotta with steamed milk and an almond-cinnamon biscotti  which was an improvement in the desert spectrum yet carried with it its own fallacies, namely a muted flavor; but this may have been due to the fact that I was drinking a very respectable cappuccino with a mocha flavored dessert. The Apple Cider Fritters with madagascar vanilla bean ice cream and apple cider caramel won out as the best confection in my book. Though deemed too sweet by some in my party, which was true, I found them a perfect with my aforementioned cappuccino. The cinnamon and sugar married well with apple - a welcome update to a classic. Also, an honorable mention should be made to the great biscotti served along side Panna Cotta, they were crisp and yet not in the least stale - a grand accompaniment for the  cappuccino as well. \n\nAs for the main course, well - all I can attest to is that the fish and chips were a grandiose disappointment. Toro was used in place of chips, which only added to the surprising lacking favor. If it were not for the dipping sauces the dish would have had no flavor what-so-ever. I will admit that the dish was not in the least greasy nor was the fish over cooked. It was simply a blank canvas when it came to the flavor profile of the dish as a whole. My dining companions had good things to say about the goat chili and bad things to day about the Lobster Paella but as I did not partake I will refrain from judging.\n\nFinally, there was the creme de la creme of the meal - the appetizer, particularly, the rock octopus with thinly sliced artichoke in a lemon olive oil dressing. This was without a doubt the best part of the meal. The flavors of the dish were harmonious and the texture of the octopus was done just right - resilient but not tough. In fact, I would  be on the merit on this dish alone that I would return to Square 1682.\nSo, if you find yourself one night sitting in 1682 wondering how to start your meal - heed my advice and get the octopus, then consider getting a drink and hitting the road.", "p": [], "n": ["Restaurants"]}, {"business_id": "YAUUdbESr8BYQ_TFgDjT5Q", "name": "Tokai Sushi Hibachi Steakhouses", "date": "2009-06-21 18:54:29", "stars": 5.0, "text": "Note: the webpage linked is a PDF of their menu.

Much like Morimoto's or POD, To-Kia fancies a serene aesthetic and avant-garde cuisine that stops just short from scaring off the locals. Not an easy angle to play, if you ask this Yelper.\nYet, I must admit, the place comes of sharp, sleek, minimalist and though I hate to use this term \"zen-like.\" And perhaps most importantly this place does all this without Steven Starr's bucks to throw around. Just view the shots I snapped while scampering about the place. \n\nThe place is also stocked with polite little Asian woman working front of house, whose ages I can scantly guess. Each of which are quicker at their jobs and more mannerly then the prior. While back of house seems to be run by menfolk, cutting sushi and sushimi at the sushi bar and manning the grill in back. (Don't forget to tip them too.)\n\nAs for the food, its presentation and freshness is striking. With rotating specials such as live scallop, Hamachi - Kama , and, I believe, even Blue Fin Tuna this place is second to none. \nWhile there sampled:\nExtra Spicy Sashimi Salad tuna, a mixture of salmon, yellow-tail,seaweed, spices and masago, Seared Strip Bass with foie gras sushi w/ Fuji Apple as well as large variety plate of Sushimi.\nAll of which ranked high on my delic-o-meter and each marine morsel was so tender I wept secretly just a bit. \nMy dining companions also let me taste their turf dishes. \nI was less impressed on this end of the menu, I felt both the Beef Bulgogi and Katsu were middle of the road on the whole primarily because  the meat was a bit tough though flavorful. The yakitori, however, was pretty good.\n\nI have hope that the air-sucking end of the menu will improve since the restaurant seems to have purchased an neighboring lot to create a hibachi.

The warm colors, walls of wine bottles and tall ornate ceilings complete with crystal chandeliers knocked me on my ass. It was instantly clear that the business owners knew how to take advantage of the City's historical architecture. The beauty of the dining hall, however, was hampered by a noteworthy echo created by the high ceilings, which resulted in a noisy dining environment.\n\nOnce we were seated we were explained by our waiter the churrascaria way of serving and it was grand. You get a card, green on one side -red on the other; Green means \"keeps it coming wit' the meat\", red means \"Stop- I'm dyin!\"  The slabs of meat keep coming, with no limit, for 50 bucks a head. ($25 for lunch, with the same selection)\n\nThe service was stupendous. The clearing of plates and refilling of the drinks was so fast I hardly noticed the waiters going through the motions of their profession. Food service was still a bit distracting since waiters would pop out without warning holding sizzling skewer of meat. This made the dining experience feel a bit like being accosted be meat ninja sometimes. (waiters need bells on each of 'em)\n\nNow as for the food, little can be said food that has not been said already. The seasoning tended towards salty and suited the Churrasco flavors. Nothing was too lean. If you ask for well done, got well done.\n\nHighlights included garlic steak, fillet mignon, bacon wrapped fillet mignon, and the chicken. \n\nThe lamb was majorly disappointing though - way too gamey and tough. (and I Love lamb)\n\nThe salad bar was impressive, but NOT worth $50. (or even $25) So, if you are a vegetarian this is not somewhere you should tag along with your carnivorous buddies.\n\nAll in all a good meal.\nA solid 4 out of 5 if you're talking lunch.", "p": ["Steakhouses", "Brazilian", "Restaurants"], "n": []}]}

The tomb was too thin and did not have enough garlic. The fries were a bit over fried. \n\nThe kibbeh nayah was a joke. For $15, there was practically no lamb. Also, a perfect nayah should have just salt and pepper so the lamb can be the star.  What they did was mask the flavor of the raw lamb with odd herbs and spices, which were not tasty at all. \n\nFor dinner, my dad ordered the kefta. I ordered the kawarma. My wife ordered the whole fish, and my cousin ordered the baby chicken. The whole fish was the best tasting dish of the entire night. The fish was grilled to perfection and topped with a delicious tomato sauce. However, it did not really represent a Lebanese dish to me. While whole fish is popular in Lebanon, it is certainly not representative of the heart of the cuisine. Also, at $40, it did not come with any sides and was extremely overpriced. \n\nThe kawarma  did not taste like Lebanese-style lamb. It had a strange sweet pomegranate sauce on it. While it did not taste bad, it is undoubtedly a fusion dish. The portion was way too small for $27 and did not come with a side. I ordered a side of tumeric rice, and it was some of the worst rice I've ever had. It tasted mostly bland with an offensive after taste. It was also over cooked. It was not traditional Lebanese rice. Waste of $6.00. \n\nThe kefta was not kefta. My dad could not even eat it. The flavors were foreign to him. For me, it did not taste terrible, but tasted nothing like kefta. I have more of an adventurous palate, so I thought the spice was interesting, but we all agreed it was a terrible kefta. The chicken was well spiced but there was not much meat on the chicken. It was also very overpriced. \n\nThe kanafeh dessert was pretty good. The tehina hot chocolate was very unique. My dad did not like it, so I drank it.  \n\nOverall, disappointing experience. They definitely sold out for more popularity. They dumbed down the flavors to cater to the American palate. Do I blame them? I guess not. But as someone who knows Lebanese food, I will not be back. Our experience made us very sad that Cedars on 2nd Street closed. I hope Cedars reopens.

We booked the reservation in early November. There were two set tasting menus to choose from, and we went with the more expensive tasting, priced at $90 per person. When we arrived, a server attempted to seat us at a hightop table in the bar section as opposed to the much more beautiful dining room. We objected to being sat there. While they immediately sat us in the dining area, we found their attempt to seat us at the bar to be distasteful and poor judgment, especially considering how much we were about to spend on dinner. It was not a good start. \n\nThe meal began with a plate of crudo, which was essentially sashimi style raw fish. This was ok but really small, and we were starving. The menu online stated that we would get a mixed cheese plate, but we never did. The next plate was the cured Iberian pork, which was by far the best thing we had. The meat was stuffed with spinach, so it was pretty much a cured meat salad. The taste of the cured meat was unforgettable. Also, the wine pairings were on point. \n\nUnfortunately, the last few plates were only OK. The lobster scrambled egg plate was not well executed. The asparagus left more to be desired. One plate was a few slices of wagyu beef. A great cut of meat, but it was bland and essentially raw. While I like meat very rare, there were some at the table that didnt, and the server never asked us how we would like the meat cooked. \n\nI understand that holiday event tasting menus are not always the best way to get to know a restaurant, but I wasnt intrigued enough to say with certainty that I'd return.

I think Ralph's has safety made it past that first year.  This is the oldest family owned restaurant in the US, having been open since 1900.\n\nMy wife and I went on a Sunday evening with a groupon.  We were seated quickly upon entering on the second floor.  Please note this is a three story restaurant and there is a good chance you'll have to hike up some stairs to eat.  \n\nOnce seated we ordered an appetizer (muscles in red sauce) and a couple of drinks.  The muscles were very good and the red sauce was great.  The bread they give out I believe if from Sarcone's next door and is good, although I can understand how people might be turned off by an unwarmed loaf of bread in a basket, when warm bread with olive oil is starting to become the norm at many italian restaurants. \n\nFor our entrees I got a pasta with redsauce and filet tips and my wife got a stuff chicken dish.  Both were very good.  The pasta seemed to be made in house and the filet tips were good.  My wife's chicken was very good as well.  But the highlight of both of are meals was the red sauce.  Very tasty, not too chunky yet not watery either.  \n\nOverall, I'll be back to Ralph's, although next time I will probably go a more simple route and just order spaghetti with red sauce as it is the sauce that is king here, and everything else takes a back seat.  \n\nThe service was good even though the restaurant was busy.  The biggest downside I feel was the price of the drinks was high.  I had two yuenling's and my wife had two martini's and our drink total was $32.  I'm guessing the martini's were $10 or $11 a piece and the beers were $5 or $6, which seemed high considering the neighborhood. \n\nAlso it was a bummer that this place is CASH ONLY.  They have an ATM in the back but I hate places that pass the fee on to the customer through an ATM charge.  \n\nIn general, a good spot with good simple italian food.

And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. \n\nAs my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to \"make me something awesome with whiskey in it.\" \"What kind of drink do you want?,\" he inquired. \"I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these.\" (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the \"The Commodore\" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.\n\nWhen our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can't wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious.\n\nWarning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. \n\nAll in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable.

The totality of the Vetri restaurant is one of the best you will experience in Philadelphia. So why the 4-star rating? Well, the answer lies within the question (sorry to get all socratic on you) \"Was it worth it?\" One way to construe this question is to reframe it as \"are you happy you went?,\" in which case the answer is a resounding yes. Here are the details:\n\n- food: We had a nearly identical menu to the one PhillyBestByob X. enumerates, and helpfully accompanies by pictures of each dish. In addition, the chef sent out a special course of truffled risotto, which huge truffle shavings. We all (a party of 5) tasted each others' dishes and so we got to try much of the menu. I likened the experience of the tasting menu to reading a very good book that occasionally displays flashes of genius. All of the meal was delicious, but every now and again, you would get a bite that made you question the bounds of what it's possible to do with food. Some of these moments include:\n\n- pastrami-spiced foie - I had never had foie and would never order it in a restaurant, but this dish was in the realm of the sublime\n\n- house-cured Calabrese salami - A+ for authenticity. It tasted just like the soppressata my family in Calabria makes. I was really impressed with this. \n\n- piedmontese carpaccio with figs - I sincerely hope that you get this dish should you go\n\nThe pastas are generally fantastic here, too. The place where I thought the meal settled into good-but-not-great was in the main courses we had (lamb, goat). \n\nI'm sure you already know this from other reviews, but there is one menu option at Vetri: the tasting menu at $155/pp. \n\n- drinks: Vetri offers several pairings or a la carte drinks. They have 2 tiers of wine pairings, one at $90 and one at $135. They also have a beer pairing for $70. I'm not cheap about food and drinks (as evidenced by the fast the I came here), but the pairings just don't seem like a good deal to me, especially the beer pairing. My wife ordered a glass of pinot noir ($19) to go with her meal, and the pour lasted her the whole meal (and she wasn't nursing it). \n\nThe Pinot Noir here is just spectacular, BTW. I would highly recommend it. \n\nMy friend and I split a big bottle of Baladin Noel ($26), and it lasted us the whole meal, too (with three of four refills of our glasses). My friends who got the beer pairings were not sure it was worth it at the end. \n\nThe service: nothing to say here except that it was perfect. They struck just the right balance between being there to get us everything we needed and explaining every dish with not being overbearing. Really impressed. \n\nSo this brings us back to our initial question--\"what is worth it?\"--and the other way to conceptualize the question, which is \"would you do it again?\" At an $1100 check for 5 people (pre-tip), or about $265/pp after tip, it's a tough one when you consider opportunity cost. For that amount of money, you could have several meals at several fantastic options around the city. I'm not sure I would go here again at the expense of several other great meals, but I am so glad that I did come here. Hence, the 4 stars. \n\nSo my advice to you would be to check out Vetri at least once for the experience.

I asked about it, they brought over a rib roast, and I decided I had to have a piece of it. So I asked for a 1\" thick steak.

There are probably 12 or so seats at the bar, and maybe 8 tables in the dining, and the aesthetic is a warm, country tavern sort of feel. \n\nWe sat at the end of the bar, next where the owner was standing, unbeknownst to us. We started chatting about food, and we mentioned that my wife doesn't like mushrooms. He said, \"if I send you out some of our mushroom fries for free, will you try them.\" Of course, we happily agreed, but my wife was skeptical. He brought them out shortly after, she tried them, and had to concede that she liked them! And well she should: they were amazing. They are basically portobello caps sliced, breaded, and fried, served with a mushroom aioli. Don't miss these. He also sent us out a free order of their summer slaw, which was amazing.\n\nWe read all of the Yelp reviews beforehand, so we knew that people love the wings and burger here, so we went for them. Good choice. This is seriously one of the best burgers in the city, and I travel around the city looking for the best burgers. They marinate the meat overnight, and whatever their marinade is is perfect--it imparts a subtle flavor to the meat, but doesn't get in the way. The bread and cheese here are also very high quality. Don't miss the wings, either. They are triple cooks (roasted, grilled, and fried) for the perfect texture. Again, a very unique, special dish. \n\nThey are also open late for dinner, and have a special $9 after 9 menu, where certain fully composed plates (fish and chips; steak, mashed potatoes, and a vegetable; etc) are only $9. That's a killer deal, especially for people like us who always go out late.\n\nAll the while we were enjoying our food, the bartender was keeping our glasses full with some top-tier gin.

It's in a building/house on Drexel's campus, and is open and airy with original wood floors, etc. It feels like you should hang out here all day, drink coffee, and discuss how Breaking Bad partially adheres to the form of the classical Greek tragedy (at the expense of actually doing the reading you need to do to prepare for class). \n\n2) the food: the menu is pretty expansive, offered breakfast all day alongside lots of great lunch and dinner options. They also have a whimsical take on naming their specials, going for names that capture the zeitgeist (what's 'trending,' if you will), like \"Gus Fring's Pollos Hermanos Chicken and Waffles.\" \n\nMy favorite dish on the menu for lunch is the Cali-Turkey sandwich. It's thick-sliced turkey on an amazing toasted, whole-grain bread, with alfalfa greens and roasted red pepper mayo. It comes with bacon, but I sub out the bacon for the delicious housemade long hots. I also sub in a salad for fries, as their side salad is amazing: slices of strawberry, goat cheese, etc. \n\n3) the staff: I usually get the same waitress (as I usually go at the same time), and I like her very much.

We looked over the menu for awhile, and I asked how the tea-smoked duck was. He shook his head and said \"I don't like it.\" Uh, well if this guy is supposed to be selling dishes and he says it's no good, I will trust him, I guess. So we ordered the pork belly in garlic sauce to start, followed by the spicy beef soup, and then the waiter's recommendation, the dry fried chicken. \n\nThe best part of the meal was the pork belly. It was really delicious. I liked the beef noodle soup, too. It was a huge bowl full of dan dan noodles in a spicy broth with chunks of tender braised beef. You could really taste the cilantro too. My only critique is that it's a little oily. The dry fried chicken was not great. It was super salty and the majority of the dish is comprised of inedible, ornamental hot peppers. At something like $12, it's not a great value and wasn't that tasty. I mostly filled up on the pork belly. \n\nThe main problem was that I spent nearly the entirety of a spicy meal attempting to get my water glass filled. If you're going to serve spicy food, you had better be filling people's glasses. I managed to get it filled once toward the end of the meal and another time by waving my hands in the air before we left.

By mid December, there was no chance that was going to happen.  My ten week program turned into about five sessions - that's it.\n\nBy January 2013, more emails, and the place seemed to be closed, with owners, former owners, fraudulent owners, and hopeful owners sorting out business.  I have given up on ever getting the value of the 10-week package I had purchased, and in fact, there is no one at Rowzone, it seems to me, able to speak for the former, fraudulent or would-be owner under whose watch the package was purchased.  \n\nThis weekend, however, sparked another development in the Rowzone Saga.  I received an email that sounds like Rowzone is up and running, the website will be opened to scheduling, and while the new(?) owner will not be able to reimburse me for the prior program I purchased, she will recognize the vouchers that I bought for five sessions (an additional $70 bucks). \n\nI am going to go to the voucher funded sessions. I will write a review on the revamped place, assuming it is actually in business, and you can decide if this will work for you.

Trainers really aren't \"personal\" trainers. They have a set program that they put people through and you have very little to say about what you like/don't like. The trainers work with several people in a session so depending on how many people are in a session you could be waiting for the trainer to get back to you or waiting for the person in front of you to finish. One of the things that frustrated me is they want you to push through the routine they have come up for you in the hour's time. The sessions are hard with ropes, sleds, balls, bands, cables, weights and the most uncomfortable stationary bike I've ever had to sit on (and they make you end every session on the thing). No two sessions are alike - so if you like variety then great, if you like consistency or at least enough repetition to get the moves and form down then not so great. I seldom found a session to be fun or enjoyable, rather I often felt like I was a contestant on the Biggest Loser. They also play hip-hop all day long and you either like it or you don't. The environment and training is designed (in my opinion) to appeal to 20-30yo demographic.\n\nIf you really want to push yourself beyond your limits and don't care how you get there then you might really enjoy the MBSC program. If you want a professional personal trainer to spend quality time with you in achieving your goals and if you want a training program that you actually learn what muscle groups you are working and not just to be pushed through a routine then you probably won't like MBSC. Definitely do a introductory program because the usual 30 day notice from the contract date applies if you cancel and it's $200+/mo program.", "p": [], "n": ["MBSC", "Trainers"]}, {"business_id": "j1WFr8rSrekUgTNy4NudxA", "name": "Govberg Jewelers", "date": "2014-12-22 13:36:25", "stars": 5.0, "text": "The customer service at Govberg's is fantastic.

I was already paying the diagnostic fee of 69 dollars, I figured the simple act of disabling the problematic software wouldn't be a big deal.  On their side though, they felt is was worth charging me half of the value of their quote to do the complete repair and removal of the software.\n\nIn the end, it just felt like their diagnostic charge of $69 was a hook used in hopes of getting much more out of a customer.

Compared to the innumerable tofu disasters I've experienced at other East-Asian restaurants, I thought it was excellently cooked!  The broccoli included was fresh and also well-cooked.  The portion was enormous, which explained why the price was a few dollars over what I was used to.  I had to order an extra portion of rice, since I knew their dishes come with far less rice than they should.  For the extra rice, it cost probably more than it should, but the carton was packed as full as it could be, so I oughtn't complain.\n\nBoyd enjoyed his beef with broccoli, and Graham and Sean both enjoyed their respective fried rices.  I took advantage of the Grubhub coupon that got me a box of the world's most addictive substance - those fried Chinese donuts - and there were, like, twenty of them.

Come along with me, as I journey back in time -- all the way back to Wednesday...\n\nI step foot in this 7 Eleven, and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen. It is very clean, bright, and spacious. Very nice looking selection of prepared meals. There were many that actually looked like they'd be quite good. But I wasn't hungry this day. No. All I needed were a few items. \n\nFirst, some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper, the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there. Or some perverted freak named Scott. \n\nIn any case, I got myself 4 rolls. And then I just needed one more thing - some plastic cups for a little party I'm having this weekend. \n\nI go ahead and drop my stash on the counter, begin to extract several singles from my wallet, when the cashier looks at me and says, \"24.99.\"\n\nI respond, \"That's not right.\"\n\nHe points at a price tag on the plastic cups which reads 19.99. I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile, I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check, I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.\n\nAt around that same moment, the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was, in fact, incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.\n\nTHAT'S the unscrupulous part.\n\nCLEARLY, THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less, thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this. Why, because I'm white, and you're a racially superior Indian? You think white people are stupid don't you?

I use the term filling loosely because after biting into the flakey crust, I struggled to find the bananas. There was a thin layer of smashed bananas and cinnamon sugar at the bottom and 75% of the interior was empty space. \n\nThe new hope soda: The birch beer (the actual name of the soda escapes me at the moment but it is birch beer) was the highlight of my meal. Everything you would expect from a Pennsylvania birch beer and very refreshing, which surprised me because I normally don't like fountain sodas and prefer root beer.\n\nI gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 because nothing was horrible.

This is \"let's go back and work our way through the menu\" Italian.  We found the specials to be good choices.  My husband's broccoli rabe and sausage was excellent, as was a grilled romaine salad with bleu cheese and pine nuts.  Both were generous enough to share.  Last time, sausage & figs was a hit.

We went from seats behind the old picnic area at the Vet, to seats down the 1st base line, to seats behind home plate.  At the Cit, my DH took the plunge & bumped up to Diamond Club.  There is no way we could go to every game, nor could we afford to foot the bill for the whole season, so we have a group of friends who split things up.\n\nI really like the Cit.  It takes the concept resurrected by Camden Yards & improves on it.  One of the thinks I dislike about the stadium in Baltimore is that you can't circumnavigate the park easily & still see the game.  At the Cit, you can go in a continuous loop around the stadium, pausing as you wish to lean on the railings to watch the game.\n\nThe thing I like least about the Cit is that it has nothing else around it that would make it a destination.  Baltimore has a ton of restaurants/bars within walking distance.  The Cit. has McFadden's.  Oh, and there's Chicky n' Pete's, if you want to take the Crab Taxi.  No thanks.\n\nOur seats are fabulous, but we also like to watch a game occasionally from the outfield -- more \"real\" fans out there instead of corporate types or friends of corporate types.

I admit it.  I just can't stay away.\n\nI started ordering from Tiffin for lunch almost as soon as word was out that they did this cool lunch thing called \"tiffins\".  Modeled after a lunch-time practice in India, It's a set meal consisting of 3 dishes plus basmati rice and a few accompaniments (relishes).  Each day they offer 3 different tiffins:  there is a common vegetable dish, a common dahl and a main dish that is different -- you can select from one of 2 vegetarian dishes or one meat dish.  The cost is $7.50 for veg and $8.50 for meat.\n\nYou used to be able to order just a single tiffin, but I think the high price of gas, plus the fact that many people weren't even tipping the delivery people, made them put a $15 minimum on delivery.  That means you either need to order with someone else & get 2 tiffins, or increase your order by adding a side dish, a bread, an app or even just by ordering a regular meal instead of a tiffin.  You can order by phone, or you can order on their website.  I find it really convenient to order on the web site.  I even pay for it (including the tip, if I wish), via PayPal.  That way, when the food is delivered, all I have to to is meet the delivery person, smile, and begin drooling -- no wasted time fumbling for cash.\n\nI work in center city (west), between Suburban and 30th Street Stations.  You can pick your lunch delivery \"window\" as 11-12 or 12-1.  No matter which I choose, it usually gets there noonish.  Since I work in a high-rise, the driver calls me about 2 minutes out so I can just pop on down to the lobby to fetch my lunch.  I have even ordered for later in the day, and ordered a \"feast\" to take home on the train for dinner.  My husband likes Indian food, but my daughter will KILL for it, so it's usually a party when I bring it home.  The down side is that I need to put up with stares on the train because the aroma tends to waft through the car and cause spontaneous IFFs (Indian Food Fits) amongst the other passengers.  I find it's also wise to have another bag I can put the Tiffin bag into just to avoid leakage.\n\nThe food is awesome.  It is spicy, so be forewarned  (my tolerance for spicy food is not as great as it used to be).  They will not adjust the spice on the tiffin meals, probably because they are making them in bulk and Indian food has layered spices -- you can't just add a dash of hot sauce at the end to take it up a notch.  Be careful to check your order.  They are a lot better than they used to be, but sometimes an item is missing, sometimes they forget to give you a plate or plasticware.  If you do find a glitch, just call them and they will do their best to make it right.\n\nWhether you just want a treat at lunch that will drive your coworkers crazy with the smell, or want to make an event of it by getting a bunch of people to order at the same time, give Tiffin a try.  They post their new weekly menu on Sunday, so you can check out the website on Sunday night to get your juices flowing for the week to come.  They also have monthly app and main dish specials.  I have found that they are branching out more and more lately with different dishes, probably as the result of input from a new chef, therefore they repeat old favorites, but also have some very interesting new things.  Now they've added a \"Tiffin card\" that you can sign up for, promising deals like \"a Tiffin and a movie\", a free meal on your birthday, and other stuff.  You can be the first in your neighbor hood or cube farm to have one!\n\nIf you see the Mango Chicken or Butter Chicken, jump on it!

They ranges from $7-13, which is a generally fair price for drinks that often contain higher end ingredients like fruit juices, Luxardo Maraschino, Bulleit Rye, etc. I ordered a Hemingway, their take on the classic Hemingway daquiri, which had rum, grapefruit, lime, simple, and Maraschino liqueur was a bit bland and watery. The classic Hemingway has a double shot of rum--not that I necessarily expected this, but wanted a strong, sour, aggressive drink was what I expected for a drink named after the rugged Hemingway. The other cocktails our table ordered: old fashioned, Manhattan variant (with Pimms), and bourbon sour (with frothed egg white) where well made. Friends that ordered beer where very happy with the selection. \n\nFood was well priced, large portion sizes and generally at least above average in quality. We ordered and loved the fried pickles. The coating was substantial but not doughy and crisp without being greasy. The honey mustard was just sweet enough to balance the acidity of the pickle. For an entree I ordered the fried chicken. He chicken was brought to the table while still very hot and had a nicely crisp coating that almost shattered on contact but still hung on to skin. The meat was well salted, but I would have like some more spices like black pepper, chili pepper, paprika, garlic powder etc. The chicken came with Mac and cheese served in a large ramekin that was easy twice as much as I expected! The sauce was very creamy and the topping of melted cheese and crisp bacon crumbles was very tasty. My friends enjoy the burger (hell of a deal at $5), the Cobb salad, pulled pork sandwich, and seitan cheesesteak. However, the fries were disappointing limp and greasy. \n\nI thought the decor was understated, classic  bar decor (dark wood everywhere, quirky taxidermy) but also easily forgettable. I did like how they kept the original tile around the fireplace past the bar that spelled out \"LIBERTIES,\" a nice nod to the bar that use to be B&B. Tables were nicely separated and chairs/booths were comfortable. \n\nOverall, I think the prices are more than competitive for most food and drink. Service was laidback and easygoing without being complacent. Food came out hot and tasty, drinks cold and refreshing. I just had some minor complaints about the food and drinks but overall had a very good experience.

I've always gotten great service from the staff, well prepared food of proper portion size and good beers.  I really like the Mini-corndogs, burger, and their fries.  It's typical barfood that anyone can find something to eat and there are even some veggie options.  The beer here is great, I've had several rare Russian River, Founders, Bells, Port, Lost Abbey, and Founders beers here that are rarely available on the East Coast and they often have beer promotions if you sign up for the newsletter.\n\nEven on New Years day during their terribly busy 1 year anniversary party, Brendan, the owner, stopped to talk to me and my friend about making a selection from a number of their rare beers and the food they were giving out for free.\n\nI think a lot of the negative reviews here are unwarranted and I just wanted to spread the word that it's not been all bad, in fact I've had some great experiences here.  Another reviewer mentioned that they were annoyed because of the seating policy here, but I have to say that I like this.

I had a list: luxe amenities, washer/dryers in unit, good views, fitness center, doorperson, on the square, dog-friendly. \n\nMy first two appointments were canceled because of snow. When I finally got in, I was unimpressed with the lobby. But more importantly, there was ALWAYS something a little off happening.  EVERY time I went staff people in the lobby were having either loud, personal, or un-interruptible convos, making me just have to sit or stand there.  More than once I had to listen to the tail end of some conversation before a staff person located my appointment.\n\nWhen I was finally shown apartments upstairs, again, there was always just SOMETHING a little off for a luxury space: shoes in the hallway; umbrellas propped outside, noise.  All of these things are ok in some buildings, but the Claridge markets itself as a luxury space, and typically that sort of thing is frowned upon. \n\nThe final thing that bothered me was the pricing.  I had a number (+/- a couple hundred bucks or so) in mind, and one that was more than reasonable given my research of other buildings on the square.  I was looking in January for a move-in in March, and the monthly price differed by HUNDREDS of DOLLARS.  So in essence, if I were to have signed a lease in January for a March 1 move-in, I'd have paid several hundred dollars more than if I signed the lease for a January move-in.  I recognize that some buildings use this system, but ultimately, the difference in price for the same apartment was a huge turnoff, as was the non-refundable pet deposit. Just call it a fee :) \n\nNo washers or dryers in the apartments! There are machines on each floor, however. But still a no go for me given the little issues above. \n\nThe fitness and shared spaces on the second floor are INCREDIBLE, and the dog wash space is really cool too.

Basically it is steamed Wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil. Just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste. Take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but I digress. Finally we tried the Talapia Medallions .

As such you can almost always find something you're looking for (sans new releases) without going to a major chain.\n\nIf you do have to go to a major chain, your primary choices are Borders Books at Chestnut & Broad and this Barnes & Noble location on Rittenhouse Square. Like everything on the park, this B&N carries a residual snottiness that I find a little pretentious, and so I don't go there often.\n\nMy first and biggest gripe is that on many occasions when I've gone in their front door security guard demands the right to check my bag. We have to get into this big conversation about profiling, the rights of loss prevention, the rights of private establishments VS the right to be protected from illegal searches/seizures, and I hate that. As a rule I avoid places that demand they check your bag because it is inherently sexist (they never check women's purses) and I find they target \"certain types of people\" to bother about it (usually including me.) The bottom line is private retail establishments do not have the right to demand upon searching or seizing your bag as a qualifier for allowing you inside.\n\nMy other gripe about this B&N is that the service inside ranges from extremely helpful and sweet to extremely skulky and rude. I visited on 5/1/08 to meet a professor friend who was going to sit in the cafe and grade papers. He was delayed and I ended up having half an hour to browse. To a bibliophile like myself, a half an hour of free time in a bookstore could lead to $500 in unexpected purchases. But when I feel like every employee is staring holes through my head while I shop, I mentally switch from shopping mode to \"making a list of things I'm interested in so I can by them at home on ebay\" mode.\n\nOn this visit I stopped by the info desk and there were two women who were extremely helpful. They offered to page my friend over the intercom, joking that the humiliation factor alone was worth it. They also directed me to the 2nd floor pay phone and to the cafe to get change to USE said pay phone. Lovely young ladies. Unfortunately we were interrupted by another security person - this time a woman who was clearly working in loss prevention - who came over and gave me a pseudo lecture/hard time about a stuffed animal I was carrying around (an item I had found in the store and had intended to purchase.)\n\nIn terms of selection, this B&N is really not that special - it has exactly what every other major location has. So really I have neither praise or pan for B&N in Philadelphia: it is what it is and it's what they all are, and anyone familiar with the chain should know exactly what to expect here.\n\nBy the by, at the cafe I got an extra large - excuse me, \"Venti\" - Italian Soda for $2.30 with tax. However, I marked the price range as expensive, because in today's competing world where newly released hardcover books are often severely marked down on Amazon.com or other retailers, B&N continues to have very high product prices.", "p": [], "n": ["Shopping"]}, {"business_id": "9nktzZKO3QhBRbzUgcf1ew", "name": "US Post Office", "date": "2015-02-24 14:45:44", "stars": 1.0, "text": "Last year at Christmas time I had a fiasco involving delivery of a package that was completely the fault of the employees of this post office. The package had tracking on it, and on the day it was supposed to be delivered it wasn't. The next morning a note showed up in the online tracking info saying an attempted delivery was made and a slip was left. I was home all day, and no one attempted jack, nor was there a slip.\n\nThis happened numerous times over the course of 10 days or so, and I kept calling and addressing it with employees at their location who kept giving me excuses that didn't match up with what was being entered into tracking. One day I was told the delivery woman turned around in the middle of her shift and quit for the day because she was getting frostbite on her feet, and yet the note on the tracking said an attempted delivery had been made and a slip left.\n\nAfter more than two weeks I filed a complaint with the main office and said I suspected my package had been stolen by a postal employee. I eventually got a call back from the manager of this office, who told me he was going to go out to the truck, find my package, and deliver it himself. To his credit he did do this, though it took him until late in the evening so I had to sit at home on my ass waiting. All in all the package reached my hands more than 30 days late... and the contents were broken.\n\nNow it's a little over a year later and I am struggling to get this office to honor scheduled package pick ups. I moved away for half a year and then moved back to a different house serviced by this same station. If you're not aware, you can schedule for your carrier to pick up packages from your home if you are unable to transport them to the post office. I run a home business and I don't drive, so I rely on this service. You schedule it online, get a confirmation number and you can choose to have the pickup happen during your regular delivery window, or pay $20 for pickup at a time you choose.\n\nLast Saturday I scheduled a pickup and they didn't come, so I called Monday and spoke to someone who asked the address and then said they would come that day. No one came, so now it's Tuesday and I have 7 packages that need to go out that are just sitting here.

And it couldn't be more intentional: having had the sad fortune of interacting with the owner, a lady who is far more interested in image than product, it is no small fact that you are supposed to be fooled into thinking you're at a cool coffee bar.\n\nBut you're not. You're at a laundromat. A cramped, sweaty, overpriced laundromat.\n\nThe foundations are no different than any other laundromat: washers and dryers are packed in so tight that you can barely maneuver your way through. There is NO seating; which is to say there are a few (3 maybe) rickety folding chairs which are rarely free for use.\n\nIt is HOT and CRAMPED. Did I mention that? The only way to remain comfortable is to go sit outside, where they have put some nice wooden benches.\n\nThe cost is pretty high in comparison with other places, and you can't help but figure you're paying extra to be \"hip\". One load of laundry is $1.25 and the dryer goes up by 6 minutes for every quarter you chuck in. Unless it's the weekend, at which point those prices double.\n\nPeople comment on the art that is displayed here and the live bands that sometimes play. Neither are very good. The art that is hung up is usually horrendously bad, with the occasional tolerable item gracing the walls. It screams \"Freshman art student.\" Honestly, if they could ditch the artwork and instead make more room to move around or be seated, I wouldn't complain.\n\nThe staff is a disaster. They have a penchant for hiring young-ish emo types who play Tori Amos all day and don't make eye contact. Recently they have replaced several of them with some Hispanic staff who, bless their hearts, simply don't have enough of a mastery of the English language to be in a customer service position. Just today I called to find out if they were keeping regular hours for Labor Day, and the young woman who answered my call couldn't make heads or tails out of my question.\n\nThe bottom line is that Tenth Street Laundromat is nothing special masquerading as something special. In point of fact it is sub-par in terms of price, customer service and comfort.\n\nTo quote Stephen Sondheim: \"Nice is different than good.\" Don't be fooled.", "p": [], "n": ["Laundromat", "Dry Cleaning & Laundry", "Laundry Services", "Local Services"]}]}

I was a little bit nervous, as husband has a somewhat limited (but expanding) palette, but we were hungry and thirsty and he was up for an adventure.  A summer weeknight in the city had the place pretty slow (~ 1/2 full bar, and just a few occupied tables), and we grabbed seats at the bar to keep an eye on the Phillies game.

I went with a great spinach salad with grilled shrimp, sauteed mushrooms and spiced walnuts topped with a simply delightful cane sugar balsamic vinaigrette, while my husband devoured a BBQ brisket sandwich with perfectly cooked shoestring (non-battered) fries.

They were so good that I did not even mind paying $10 for them.  However, they were NOT the best burgers in Philly.  Both were slightly overcoooked, and the meat, while juicy, would have benefited from a bit more salt or seasoning.  If I had waited 2 hours for the experience, I would have been right pissed.

Wide open, nicely paved pedestrian/bike routes run above the PATCO tracks on both sides of the bridge, though I have only ever seen the south side open.  The walkway has a noticeable incline heading to the middle of the river, and a similar descent as you head towards Camden.

The basic take-home lesson from this review is:\n\nIf you are craving really good prime rib, go to The Prime Rib.  If random circumstances land you at The Prime Rib, order prime rib.\n\nMy most recent visit was a Saturday night dinner to celebrate husband's 35th birthday.  We were seated right on time at a cozy sofa/booth, had delightful service from Carlos (I think?) all evening, and enjoyed a celebratory meal that unfolded at the leisurely pace we wanted.  In spite of the relaxation of the jacket requirement, the dining room maintains a solidly swanky vibe, and most of my fellow diners were dressed appropriately.  The Prime Rib seems to have made a conscious decision to cater to a more mature (read: old) crowd, and I do not begrudge them that.  You'll want to look elsewhere for a hot, trendy atmosphere, but this is THE place to be if you want to feel like a nubile youngster on your 35th birthday.  The noise level was appropriate for their target market, and the live piano music was nice; though, there were a few too many repetitions of \"Happy Birthday\".  By the fourth one, I could barely stifle my urge to yell out \"play The Dead\"!\n\nWe started off our meal with classic bar cocktails and a jumbo shrimp cocktail.  No complaints there - the drinks were potent and well-mixed, the shrimp were absurdly jumbo and very nicely presented.  Prior to ordering our entrees, we selected a lovely bottle of Spanish Monastrell from the well-designed list.  A great deal of thought clearly went into putting together a non-generic selection of excellent economical choices to round out their \"investment\" bottles.  The list is smaller than I am used to at high-end steak houses, but the attention to detail makes up for it.\n\nFor the heart of meal, birthday boy ordered the signature bone-in double-cut prime rib and I went with the Filet Oscar.  Let me tell you, I had serious steak envy.  That thing was so beautiful it brought a tear to my eye - perfectly medium rare, living in a little au jus pond, joined on the plate by freshly shaved horseradish...the tear is back just writing about it.  It also took the boy until dinner on Monday to finally polish it off.  My filet was a fine piece of meat, but quite petite and topped with crab that was more \"flake\" than \"lump\".  The accompanying asparagus had been steamed so thoroughly that I could mash it against the roof of my mouth with my tongue.  We were tempted by the dessert menu, but were really too stuffed to commit.  For some reason, we had also ordered fries with our meal...\n\nSo - with outstanding service, a great wine list, good cocktails and appetizers, and prime rib that actually makes me get emotional, why only 3 stars?  Here is where the price factors in and makes me less forgiving.  For well over $100 per person, perfection is the expectation and anything less is disappointing.  One star is lost for the non-prime rib entrees, squishy vegetables, and average sides.  Another star is lost for subtle irritations such as 1) chintzy flatware, 2) the clearance of my husband's butter knife with his appetizer plate and lack of anyone noticing that we shared mine for the rest of the meal, 3) the prime rib being served on a plate only ~ 1\" larger than the cut of meat itself.  We had a HUGE table.  A bigger plate would have fit with no problem and spared husband's new silk blazer from its constant \"au jus peril\".\n\nI can and will look past these issues, and know that I will be back to spend money, feel swanky, and eat prime rib (and only prime rib) at The Prime Rib.", "p": ["Restaurants", "Steakhouses"], "n": ["Bars"]}, {"business_id": "YtSqYv1Q_pOltsVPSx54SA", "name": "Rittenhouse Grill", "date": "2010-12-13 14:58:36", "stars": 3.0, "text": "The Prime Rib has been hovering on my list of Philly dining must-trys for some time now, and husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a little pre-holiday party for two on Saturday night.

We were a bit skeptical about how long we might end up waiting as we wedged ourselves into the bar to grab a few glasses of wine, but we ended up seated by 8:50 at one of the best tables in the house.\n\nOur vantage point from the upper level of the main dining room allowed us to take in the  intense decor (leopard, and mirrors, and giant Christmas roses oh my!), and diverse clientele.  It seems that the recent relaxation of the dress code means that they went from \"jackets required\" to \"anything goes\".  We saw a range from elegant couples in black tie and formal gowns to groups in jeans, sweatshirts, grubby sneakers and ball caps.  A little part of me died inside.\n\nSince we were both in the mood for prime rib, we decided to capitalize on the three-course fixed-price menu mentioned in the Yelp reviews (and The Prime Rib's own website).

Fortunately, we were able to drown our imaginary shame in a nice bottle of red wine from their modestly sized (relative to other high-end steakhouses) but wide-ranging list. \n\nWe added a shrimp cocktail to start things off, and the four ultra jumbo shrimp were scrumptious and briny, set off by a strongly spiced (but very tasty) cocktail sauce.  For the 1st course, I had the roasted tomato soup and the boy had a Caesar salad.  Both were fine starts to the meal, but nothing to get too worked up over.  We both had prime rib for the main course with string beans and steak fries.  Most importantly: meat = good!  The cuts of prime rib were generous, velvety, and mildly flavored, just as good prime rib should be; though both of the pieces (mine ordered rare, his medium rare) were slightly overdone.  The meat was generously salted and served with crisp shaved horseradish.  The sides were just okay with the beans being a little on the soft side and the fries being generally un-special.

We walked in on a rainy Wednesday night, which is why I thought this place might be a ghost town, but after reading some other reviews I think it just might be like that a lot.  Sad :(\n\nThe downstairs is really nice and clean.  I'm not really sure how to describe the decor, but it included some \"old-timey\" jars/bottles/stuff, which I liked a lot.   I didn't venture upstairs but heard there is darts and shuffle board up there.  \n\nOriginally, I was going to get some drink with muddled cucumber in it (I just liked how \"muddled cucumber\" sounded, definitely a good band name in my opinion), but I decided to go with some bourbon flights instead.  \"When In Rome,\" I thought.  Let's just say that I quickly found out that bourbon is just not my thing and had to suffer through three mini glasses of rubbing alcohol, at no fault of the restaurant (at least I was trying to be adventurous, right?).  My BF had a old fashioned and also learned that he didn't like it either.  We tried!\n\nFor dinner we got the crawfish mac & cheese, lamb sliders, and twisted house burger.  The crawfish mac & cheese was the highlight of the meal.  It was decadent and delicious with just enough crawfish in it.  Being someone who needs to pour sriracha on all mac & cheese, this was good enough just as it is.  I definitely recommend it!  The sliders were on the dry side and were just okay.  My BF said the burger was good and juicy, but they went a little overboard on the blue cheese.\n\nOn a lighter note, service was spot on - they did a really great job here.\n\nAll-in-all, I wanted this place to be awesome, but it just didn't do it for me.  I may come back in the future to see some live music (Wednesday night is blues night) and, of course, to order that mac & cheese, but I'm really not planning on going here anytime soon.\n\nPS - If you go to the Twisted Tail website and print out the August calendar, you get 10% off your dinner menu.

Before we headed upstairs to the tiny music venue, we decided to get some dinner and drinks.  It wasn't packed for a Friday night and we were able to get a table for six easily, which was awesome.\n\nQuick blurb on the architecture of this venue:  It is awesome.  I'm not even sure how to describe it, but when you're in there, make sure you turn your eyes upward to check out all of the cool details.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the drink menu is inserted into old children's books.  It's a little creepy in ways, but an interesting touch that I haven't seen anywhere else.  Kudos for being creative!  I started with the Irish Jolly, which was awesome.  I really liked the flavor of the black berries with the Jameson.  After that, I moved on to the Dark & Stormy - pretty standard, really delicious.\n\nNote:  Bourbon & Branch has FIVE $5 city wide specials.  If I wasn't driving that night, I would have had one of each.  I love when bars do this.\n\nFor appetizers, we split the Irish Nachos and the Fried Pickles.  The Irish Nachos were loaded up with bacon and beer cheddar cheese sauce, which was delicious.  As  personal preference, I could have done without the \"Irish\" part of the Irish Nachos (the kettle chips), but that's just me.  (Give me nachos; give me fries!  You can keep the chips.)  The fried pickles were pretty good.  They were perfectly fried, not too salty, and accompanied by a honey mustard sauce.  I would probably order those again.\n\nFor dinner, I went with the wild mushroom pie.  (For those that don't know, the \"pies\" are pizzas.  Some at my table thought they were actual pies, so it was a bit of a surprise when we got our orders.)  The pizza was delicious - piled high with sauteed mushrooms and bacon.  It was a touch on the salty side, but it was so good that it didn't matter.  I didn't get much of the truffle oil taste, which was a little disappointing.  All-in-all, I would order it again.  \n\nI got to taste a few of the other entrees (the bang bang chicken, pulled pork chicken, and the fish tacos), but the fish tacos were a clear winner in my book.  The fish (I believe it was basa or tilapia) was cooked perfectly and the sriracha aioli gave it a real kick in the tastebuds.  I loved them!\n\nWe also had dessert...because why not?  The Guinness Float was not my cup of tea.  It was thick in a weird way.  I guess I was expecting something like a car bomb, but instead got a soupy Guinness with a root beer aftertaste and too much whipped cream.  No thanks!  The whiskey brownie had potential, but the actual brownie was hard in texture.  Really wish this would have been warmed beforehand.   But having those be my two major complaints really isn't bad at all.  \n\nThe service was decent, drinks were awesome, and food was pretty good.

Enough for two people if you just need a quick thing to hold you over until the main course.\n\nFor my main course, I went with the boeuf bourguignon poutine.  This was salty as salty can be - I'm not overly surprised given the dish, but it was a little too salty for me.  Definitely a good hangover food, definitely not a good pregame food.  But even that said, the beef was delicious and flavorful.  I think it was the cheese and the fries that tipped the salty scale. Bummer!  (PS - Speaking of good hangover food, I mentioned to the waiter that this would be perfect for brunch if they threw an egg on it.  He said that could be done.  Do it and report back!)\n\nDessert! We split the blackberry key lime tart - it was delicious!  The crust was cooked perfectly and all of the flavors worked well together.  Really good - highly recommended from someone that isn't a big dessert fan.\n\nAll-in-all I wasn't blown away by la peg, but it also wasn't terrible.

I am not the type to complain, but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like \"why are you here. I have better things to do\"?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just \"Hey man, what can I get ya?\"  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, \"We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?\". The manager says \"Sure.\" The guy then says, \"Can we get few beers down here\"? (paraphrasing). The bartender says \"Sure!\" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, \"Hey, just shout and I will get you something\", or \"Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you\". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! \n\nLong story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else.

He disclosed this was his first shift (first time serving I think) so we knew to give him some leeway and we were fine with that as we had all been in his position before.\n\nWe got drinks in a timely fashion, which was good. However we were not approached again to order food for about 20 minutes. \n\nBeing quite hungry at that point we order apps (just 2) so we had something quickly and ordered our food at the same time since we had plenty of time to make those decisions.\n\nWe did grow concerned when we hadn't seen our apps after a half hour of waiting, but we figured the kitchen was busy and covid, etc. however we also had empty drinks and waters, and were not approached until we asked to order more drinks. \n\nAfter about an hour and 20 minutes I finally approached the host stand to kindly prod. I asked her if she could check on our food as it has been a really long time and the server had on stopped back once to say \"they're working on it I think\".\n\nThe food came out about 3 minutes after I approached the hostess. Appetizers came with the meal. Not sure if this was just a misunderstanding, but it was definitely disappointing and we had a pregnant friend at the table that was starting to eat her hands at this point. \n\nThe food was overall decent. I wouldn't rave and rant about it but it did the job. A big thing that bothered us is that a few of the dishes listed on the menu did not match what came out on our plates. There we quite a few but for instance, the avocado toast \"set\" lists the meal and 2 toasts with sautéed cherry tomatoes, pickled onions, & balsamic vinaigrette. The set actually only came with 1 toast, mine had why I believe to be feta on it, some haphazardly cut tomatoes (not sautéed), no onions, no vinaigrette, while my friend next to me who ordered the same thing had the onions on it. She was a little upset it did not come with two as described, and she also unfortunately cannot have cheese (she wishes!) so she did not eat her meal. She was not asked if she wanted something else.\n\nThe whole thing was just very messy. No consistency, mediocre food, and a long wait. They took off my friends avocado toast, and gave a 15% discount. (Don't worry, we made sure we didn't screw over the waiter) \n\nPlease work on consistency, timing, employee training and communication!

It looks like walk-ins aren't really a thing here and you need to have a large-ish group, which tbh is kind of lame (one of the pros of Urban Axes, there are walk in times and you just need 2 people total for that.. ) Anyways, we filled out our waivers beforehand so when we got there we were good to go. It came to $42/person.\n\nWhen we went to start with our time, we were paired with 2 other groups, totaling us at the 12 people max/lane. I know this is an option and they tell you this when you sign up, but it seemed super unnecessary as there was only 2/12 other lanes being used when we were there, and one of the lanes only had a group of 5, the same as us. Someone in my group said that maybe the solo group paid more, but to reserve all the spots, that would be an extra $294, so I am guessing not. With all the people working there, I think they could've spilt it better so that we could have had more time throwing, but instead there was a lot of sitting and just watching.. it was especially confusing when 3+ people were just sitting at the front desk - another lane could've been utilized (another pro for Urban Axes, they really do their best to make sure groups are smaller when added together)\n\nSo once we were paired with the 2 other groups, our 'axe master' gave us instructions and everyone got to practice. Axe throwing is fun and a good stress reliever, but this man ended up kinda stressing me out - one of my friends in my group wasn't the best at throwing and couldn't get it to stick on the board. He was giving tips at first but then was laughing at her and making fun of her to the point where she had to turn to him and ask him to stop, like very seriously. It really got her spirits down and kinda put a damper on my mood too since I could tell this stressed her out, and it wasn't fun anymore. Another person in my group really liked our 'axe master', and thought he was being fun, but I personally did not. \n\nThe vibe of the space is cool, and they do have a lot of lanes which is nice, but its over shadowed by them being like \"TAG US\" and there is just social media stuff everywhere which was a bit annoying and sends a message like \"we don't care about our current customers, we just want more! I think this company could use some marketing help.. see below.\n\nI was initially going to give Bury the Hatchet 3 stars, but unfortunately it moved to 2 stars when they started spam texting me post going there. I know you are there, I have been there. Please do not send me spam texts! (thankfully after txting 'unsubscribe' 'stop' 'quit', I was have been unsubscribed)\n\nSome pros of this place is there is a fridge for beer (its BYOB) and they have a lot of availability - plus axe throwing is fun!!

The atmosphere of the restaurant is relaxing - with only 32 seats, its on the smaller side, which means you will get plenty of attention from servers. The menu is small, but not in a bad way. They make the pasta here daily and have really fresh ingredients. Also to note, all tables get a small bread bowl after ordering (2-3 pieces). For apps, we had the meatballs which were very yummy and filling. If you want to see size, I added a picture. For entree, I had a spaghetti & clam dish which was delicious and not dry (some homemade pastas can be!) so I was very pleased with my order. And for dessert, I had the chocolate tarte.

I went to Las Cazuelas for the first time for my birthday.  We had a wonderful time.  I was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends.  This was the perfect choice.

I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables, and asked for it spicy.  My entrée had an attractive presentation on the plate (i.e. looked classy), and was delicious, well seasoned, and very fresh. On my suggestion, my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes (i.e. a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds), and it was tasty too. \n\nI should also note that the waitress was very attentive.  When I placed my order, I explained to her that I have mild lactose intolerance and can't eat much butter or cream (but am okay with cheese), so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil, rather than butter.  Thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request!  \n\nThe prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual Mexican food, and I love the fact they're a BYOB.  The chef serves creative and inspired cuisine, which has a traditional flair and style to it.  In other words: Don't come here for regular tacos or burritos.

I never even try to park in the front lot anymore.  I either walk to WaWa, or if I am driving, I park in the back lot.  Yes, WaWa has a second lot, behind the store.  Almost always an open spot.  Often times, there is 5-10 open spots back there.  \n\nGripes continued:  Often there are panhandlers.  Not really WaWa's fault, I mean we are talking Germantown Ave, in Philadelphia proper, it is a reality.  There have not been any aggressive panhandlers since 2014, so this is not a concern really any longer.\n\nMajor points for:  \n*seasonal specialties!  I look forward to autumn for the pumpkin cannoli dip and chips!  I also dig the apple cider donuts and to a lesser degree the pumpkin donuts.  \n*Prices!  Everything is reasonable!

Everywhere I went in the hotel itself, staff were happy, friendly, and welcoming. This wasn't the case only with me and it did not come across as fake or forced. I am a people watcher, so I observed the staff interacting with several guests and they were consistently good service providers. \n\nThe Red Owl Tavern has great food, and generally great service, but while I was there for brunch, there was one server behind the ready-to-eat bar in the Tavern that was in a bad mood, unfriendly, aloof, or some combination of all three. She did not acknowledge people when they ordered-she would just turn around and start getting what they asked for. She also got into it with another server who apparently experienced the same rude attitude I and my fellow patrons did. I cannot emphasize enough that almost every other person there had a great attitude and was more than friendly. One bad apple...ironic since she has red hair. I realize that the Tavern is likely under different management, but it does affect a hotel guest's experience, and in my case, it did so negatively. \n\nThe only reason I can't give the hotel 5 stars, however, has nothing to do with the Tavern. It is because our room was not touched once we checked in. Not one time. It was immaculate upon arrival, but that was the last time I saw it that way. I shouldn't have to call the front desk for either a daily once-over or turn-down service. To be fair, I in fact did not call the front desk, because I was running around almost the whole time I was in Philadelphia, but that's exactly why I wanted to come back to a tidied room. This is an oversight I did not expect from such a great chain. \n\nThe Monaco included all of the amazing features of a Kimpton hotel. My dog was warmly greeted everywhere we went in the hotel, her dog bed and bowls were already in the room, and the decor was, as always, remarkable, interesting, and quirky. The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful, and the complimentary drinks in the morning and for happy hour don't hurt!\n\nOverall, probably one of the best places to stay in Philadelphia.

So she was a little overwhelmed and watched carefully as the guy at the counter explained everything he was going to do to my papri chaat. That was no simple task, since this chaat was loaded up like you would not believe. I can't even begin to list all the things that went into it, just layer after layer of all good things. Maybe a little heavy-handed on the sauce so it got soupy toward the end, but every bite brought something new.\n\nIn fact, it was loaded up enough that we considered sharing. We were talked into getting a couple of samosas to go with, which was very kindly turned into samosa chaat just to make our tastebuds happier. And, seeing that my friend was unused to chaat, the owner told her not to pay until after she'd eaten. Very nice of him. She loved it, though!\n\nEven though were were stuffed from our chaat orgy, dessert was needed. Namely, something cold! My friend was intrigued by the sandlewood shaved ice (something I will be trying someday) but sadly the ice machine had not been delivered yet!

Over twenty world premieres have garnered accolades.  And in an amazing display of both civic duty and love for the arts, the theater has an Arden for All program that distributes tickets to Philadelphia area underprivileged students, enhancing their love and knowledge of the arts.  The quality of both, works and acting at the Arden is first class.  Undoubtedly, without any questions.  The excellence and meaning of one of them, My Three Sons, is still with me today.\n\nI subscribed for several years in my first time living in Philadelphia, and then moving to DC for five years.  Last year, I returned following my federal civil service retirement and I made a point to renew my subscription.  After a superb performance of \"Next to Normal\" last month, we just attended \"Freud's Last Session\", also of superlative quality.\n\nThe Arden Theatre is indeed a must see in the founding city of the nation.", "p": ["Performing Arts", "Arts & Entertainment"], "n": []}]}

My order was processed quickly, and I got my coffee right after I ordered it.

Each donut was a symphony of flavors on my tongue.\n\nThe Indian Cinnamon-Very light on the cinnamon, coated with sugar. Hot, fresh, and so moist that it pinched in half when I started to eat it.\n\nThe caramel banana-A delicious meld of flavors with something added to the banana chips that made them more tasty than I\"d imagined.\n\nThe pina colada-The donut I though I'd enjoy the least. However it tasted like the Rach 3 and Beethoven's 9th all rolled up. A complex mix of flavors that together was truly amazing. And unlike the current generations, I don't use that term lightly.\n\nThe halva and pistachio-the final movement. More subtle flavors that nevertheless worked well.

The Copa burger comes with mild green chiles, Monterey Jack,  and bacon on it. The chiles were decent, as was the cheese and bacon.

The fries were decent but I'm not sure they were \"award winning\". And how serving fries with little green chiles and fried onions counts as being Spanish, I don't know.\n\nThe service was ok, but not that great. It took a long time to get a second beer.

Take me to Citizens Bank Park!  Buy me some cheesesteaks and BBQ!  Crab fries, soft pretzels;  Ump, what did you do!?!\n\n I am a huge fan of baseball. It is one of my loves and my favorite sport, by far. Even though I am a huge Braves fan ( oh, shut up ), I enjoy watching any team play. However, when the Braves come to Philly, I meet them at Citizen's Bank Park. \n\nHaving lived from one corner of the USA to the next and being an extensive traveler, I have been to many stadiums around the USA, including Philly's previous Veteran's Stadium. Citizen's Bank Park is, without a doubt, the most sophisticated baseball stadium I have visited. There are three floor levels, from the main floor to the third floor you can easily reach it via an open outdoor escalator.  There are also elevators for folks who choose to use them.\n\nI've entered through different gates and I never fail to see amusements for the kids. The park staff is very friendly to all who enter their gates, but for the kiddies, they have slides, pitching balls, face painting and so much more! http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/ballpark/not_your_typical_ballpark.jsp#kids My granddaughter was picked to be on first base last year and got to stand along with the Phillies first baseman, Ryan Howard, she also has an autographed ball by him!  She was on TV and thank heavens my son, who is a huge Phillies fan, taped the game! \n\nThis stadium has more concession stands and eateries than I have ever seen at any stadium, be it football or baseball. You want food, they've got it!  Citizen's Bank Park food offerings, redefines Ballpark cuisine!   I have tried most of these places and be it a cheesesteak, crab fries, kielbasi, hot dogs, piled high sandwiches or BBQ, you will leave here filled with satisfaction. Bull's BBQ is the largest grill in all of major league baseball's stadiums. It has an outdoor picnic area and grills and BBQ's anything from turkey, pork, beef and sausages to chicken. http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/ballpark/concessions.jsp \n\nIn honor of the recently deceased Harry Kalas, they had paid homage to him with Harry The K's, which has served beverages and foods from finger food to an upscale menu. McFadden's which is a sit down eatery and Sports bar is conveniently accessed from both inside and outside of the enclosed park. \n\nI am there to watch the ballgame, food is brought to you, as well as beverages, constantly! If and when I do venture away from my seat to grab a bite, I still do not miss the game, thanks to the numerous screens and shouts from the stands. \n\nSeating is comfortable with a lot of leg room, wide screen TVs adorn this open stadium and beautiful displays of a lit up replica of the Liberty Bell, which rings every time the Phillies hit a home run. Guests also enjoy a fantastic view of the Center City skyline. Oh, by the way, that is real grass on the field.\n\nTickets can be purchased in advance and online.  This year  they have a new package that includes your ticket for the game and a $10.00 food voucher than can be used at any stand or eatery.  They sell for $32.00 -$34.00.\n\nOne thing that I will never forget and that is how badly I wanted Chipper Jones to autograph a baseball, for my Grandson.  He refused, right in front of my grandson. Later, as we sat behind the dugout, we watched a line form and who came out, Chipper Jones to sign at least 20 balls. Since then I have bought his baseball and bat, but it killed me to do so. As we were walking towards the parking lot, after the game left out, we passed the area where the Phillies players were leaving, Jim Thome got out of his Hum V and signed quite a few balls.  I gave mine to my son, since he is a big fan, but I will never forget those two episodes.   \n\nThe way I look at it, if you do not find love for this stadium, it is because you are jealous or envious. \n\nEvery time I walk into Citizen's Bank Park, I am loving it and knowing that my next few hours will be full of good times and good eats.

One voucher was for $44.00 for one dozen specialty cannoli ( which cost me $22.00 ) and the other was for $24.00 for one dozen specialty cupcakes ( which cost me $12.00 ).\n\nBefore leaving home, I had called to ask what their hours were and she stated they were open seven days per week, from 7am to 7pm. So one would think that at 2pm they would have specialty cupcakes and or specialty cannoli, but they were totally sold out. If you know that you are going to be open for another five hours on a weekend day, have more baked and ready to sell.\n\nI had two choices given to me, I could either hold onto the vouchers, which expired in two weeks and come back or accept regular cupcakes and cannoli. I chose the latter since we live a good twenty miles NE of S. Philadelphia. \n\nFor my $24.00 voucher I got 12 of the driest cupcakes I have ever purchased in my life, no flavor, although the icing was a rich butter cream, the cake was so bone dry with no flavor, I would have been better off buying a box of Duncan Hines cake mix! A quart of milk would not even be enough to wash them down! My only two choices were chocolate or vanilla, not sure how their specialty cupcakes compare, but these babies were old, stale and needed to be tossed out.\n\nThe cannoli were fabulous, a perfectly crisp cannoli with the most delicious chocolate custard, vanilla custard and mascarpone cheese with chocolate chips, I got four of each. They were not at all skimpy on the fillings, it is no wonder they have won numerous first place awards for these!\n\nMy biggest problem was, I also bought two eclairs and a rather nice sized napoleon, which were each $3.00 and the gal said, if you buy $15.00 worth, we will give you a code for receiving $5.00 towards your next Eversave purchase! Dummy me, buys two more eclairs, now one would think that since I have already lost out on my other two deals, when I inquired as to the difference in price between a regular and a specialty, it was almost double the price. You would think that she would have either given me the first three free or gave me the voucher code free at will or at least the last two to total $15. They offered me nada! AND the voucher code will not take, as Eversave says it has already been redeemed, so they must have given it out twice?\n\nThe eclairs were okay, mine are a whole lot better, but if you are not into making them, they will suffice, the napoleon was not so good, piled high, lots of custard, but the phyllo dough was all caked together like a thick and very hard dry cookie, they needed to be brushed layer by layer with butter and the word flaky never came to mind.\n\nThey had some exhibits of various cakes sitting around on the window ledges, that needed a dusting and you could see the lovely finger prints the patrons made while checking to see if they were real.

Our server immediately greeted us and offered us drinks, hubby had a coke and I had an excellent dry martini, served in a rather large cocktail glass, well chilled and made to perfection.\n \nOn the Prime Rib page of reviews on Yelp, it says to mention Yelp and you and anyone else at your table will receive a complimentary appetizer and so I did, which he was not at all enthusiastic about and it clearly showed. Then I pulled a rabbit out of my hat or rather a printed certificate from an Open Table offer that they and the Prime Rib had made publicly, to pay $25.00 up front to receive $50.00 off your bill when all was said and done. \n \nThis really did not thrill him and he was very obvious about his distaste in our lack of class ( in his mind ) to take the Prime Rib up on their own offers. Not only this but several times our server and a group of other staff members were nearby our table, talking about us and looking right at us, like how could we?! Even over at the service area for the bar, they turned and stared at us, laughing and talking. I'm serious folks, it was down right rude, made me feel like a clown and was the beginning of the most absurd service I have ever experienced.\n \nWe sat at least 20-30 minutes waiting for menus, while hubby stewed watching others being serviced and finally received our Yelp appetizer which was one large ( Diver, I'm assuming ) scallop each, wrapped in practically raw bacon on a small bed of baby spinach leaves. The scallop was cooked perfectly, I gave hubby my bacon, but he and I both agreed it was too raw to eat and then we were handed menus, which was a good forty minutes after we had been seated.\n \nWe shared the most bland bowl of lobster bisque that was served in a cool tureen style crock, absolutely no hint of sherry and I used to love their bisque, our waiter brought us a hot pepper sherry sauce in a bottle, but we passed, as it was very hot and the sherry did not even attempt to shine through.\n \nThe large oyster Rockefeller were outstanding, the escargot were tender and swimming in a garlic sauce with baby mushroom caps and a thick slice of grilled bread to dip into the sauce. The jumbo lump crab cake was large and pure but very un-adventurous other than that and was served with a lousy cocktail sauce. I had to giggle silently as the table next to us commented on their choice of sauce to serve with a lump crab cake. I myself had asked for the mustard sauce that was previously mentioned in their crab claw appetizer and it worked to help.\n \nWhen our meals came our server finally grabbed my hubby's longtime empty coke glass and refilled it and asked if I would like anything else. I asked what chardonnay they had by the glass, he offered several, not mentioning the names but the regions and I chose a Sonoma, when he brought it he had the label totally covered and poured me a sip, I asked to see the label and I was thrilled to see that it was Sonoma Cutre, one of my favorites and then he was about to walk away when I said excuse me, can you please pour my glass of wine? Oops.\n \nHubby was served a huge roast of Prime rib and he was kind enough to cut the bones off first to save for my onion soup for Christmas, his meat was cooked to perfection, tender, flavorful and juicy, however my filet was a big let down and we had already spent so much time there and just wanted to leave. I had ordered it medium rare and when I cut into the first third of it, the first cut was medium well, no pink or red whatsoever, but the center of the steak was barely pink.\n \nI was not going to say anything, but for a dry, flavorless piece of meat at $38.00 and the thinnest, un-flavorful bearnaise sauce I have ever been served, I thought this is so wrong, class or not speak up. I did and he argued with me! He said well the outer edges will be well done, I had cut one third into my steak, come on buddy this is not the first place I have had a steak is what I wanted to say, but instead I showed him the center and said it is barely a hint of pink and even the top and bottom of that was well done!\n \nTo be continued in another update, this is how upsetting this dining experience was.", "p": [], "n": ["Restaurants", "Steakhouses"]}, {"business_id": "zLViSytSrWambgwGECNyZA", "name": "Philadelphia Eagles", "date": "2009-01-12 16:49:01", "stars": 3.0, "text": "The Philadelphia Eagles have surprised many of us and probably even themselves. \n\nThey have never won a Super Bowl, but they have been to the Super Bowl and we all know they are going again!

Until that point, we kept saying it was okay, no worries, but at that point we had enough.\n \nI ordered the molletes, which I had never had before and they sounded interesting. Two long buttered rolls with a layer of black beans, cheese and a bowl of very good Pico de gallo was served on the side. I had added chorizo and over easy eggs to top the molletes. I made it a point to tell her that I liked my whites cooked but my yolks completely runny. \n \nWell my eggs came out over hard, no runny yolk whatsoever. I showed her that the yolks were hard and she was planning on taking the plate back and I said no, we have to leave, just bring me two more eggs cooked properly. I wasn't the only table who sent back food, even though I held onto mine like it was gold. The eggs came right out, I ate half of one molletes, the eggs and packaged the rest to go.\n\nTo make matters worse there was no chorizo on the molletes, but at this point I didn't even care! We were still charged for it, getting your check takes another 5-10 minutes, as she then adds up everything that you ordered.

Your muscles will always be challenged in every class.  \n\nRowzone specializes in low impact, high intensity interval training (HIIT).  This means you are on the rowing machine for a few minutes then you quickly get off the machine to do calisthenics (generally using your body weight but sometimes incorporating  low to moderate weights or resistance bands) with little rest time.  There is nothing you can't handle because you go at your own pace.  You challenge yourself but if you need encouragement to go farther you can generally find a neighbor who will help you to get more out your workout.

At first, she was a skeptic and did not want to go. On my third attempt, she finally gave me the why not approval.\n\nAfter going, we both should be asking, what is wrong with us. This place Amaze! It looks like a small place with not much to offer. The two main menu items are Lassis and Chaat. I've had a Lassi before, and it's always been Mango. But this place had like 25 Lassi flavors. But what is a Chaat I wondered?\n\nThe owner who was working there on our visit explained. There is so much that goes into a Chaat, he lost me somewhere along the way. But what was not lost was my intrigue. I go the Crazy Chicken Chaat. The crazy was their way of saying it's a chicken and beef combo. The beef reminded me of taco meat, but the kind that is seasoned extremely well.\n\nWatching him make the Chaat was like watching an artist. It was like Jackson Pollack at work with the piling on so much stuff. A threw a bunch of stuff down. Then he added 3-4 sauces. He threw more stuff down. Added more sauces. And then he threw more stuff down. Not sure I remember it all, but there was mango, almonds, crispy noodles, dates, potato, and, and, and... yeah that's what I remember. But I know there was more.\n\nWhen I put this goodness in my mouth, it was like a party of flavors. It tasted so fresh and nothing like anything I had tasted before. I was in love.\n\nI also had a peach Lassi which was excellent. My wife had the same dish as me, but got the blueberry Lassi. I liked her Lassi even better.\n\nI so am going back to this place.

There was some nice use of wood on the walls which gave Spot a cool urban vibe design.\n\nThe people that work at Spot were very friendly and helpful. They explained the specials and helped us with suggestions. I was surprised that Spot has other items such as Fish & Chips and Muscles in addition to burgers, sloppy Joe's, pulled pork and cheese steaks. Mental notes for my next visit.\n\nI went with the Spot burger; which had hickory smoked bacon, cheddar, pickles, coleslaw and Spot sauce. This was a great burger. The bun was excellent, fresh and toasted just right.  The burger was moist and juicy. The bacon was great and the slaw and sauce really made this one darn tasty burger. My daughter had the Santa Fe with Avocado, pepper jack cheese, jalapeño, red onion, sun dried tomatoes and a slightly spicy sauce. This was also a really good tasting burger! Spot really shines with their use unique toppings and sauces. \n\nWe ordered the plain fries too and these were crispy and not greasy. They were very good fries but Sketch still has my favorite fries. We had a couple of Fanta sodas too, which was pretty cool.

They kept refilling our tea and water even though they were quite busy. The soup dumplings were excellent, as good as DSG, maybe better. The crispy chicken that AJ recommended was also really tasty with some interesting spices. We had a fried fish that was very good also.\n\nShang Hai 1 is a newer, hipper, younger type of restaurants that seem to be popping up lately in Chinatown. They take credit cards too which is a big plus. We are absolutely adding this place to our C-Town rotation.\n\n4 Yelp stars", "p": ["Shanghainese", "Restaurants"], "n": []}]}

It's always great to see people doing cool ass shit with their lives, like congrats guys, seriously! There are always new things happening on the outskirts of Fishtown and with the revamp of American Street, this place is sure to become a local favorite. \n\nThe overall space is pretty cozy, and although it was crowded I wouldn't say it was packed. I only say this, because I couldn't actually hear my boyfriend who was sitting right next to me. They may need to look into something to dampen the noise levels (or reverb...?) because the space is pretty tight and all of the voices were ricocheting off the walls (I'm no scientist, just an assumption), making it feel noisier than it probably was. \n\nThey had 4 of their own beers on tap, but additionally had Pizza Boy, 2SP, and Tröeges. I got to try three of their beers, but their fourth was kicked (next time!). The beers I got to try were the Clutch Session Ale( light and crisp brewed with Cascade and Centennial) Love Bug Hazelnut (malt forward with hazelnut and chocolate), and the Punch Buggy Yellow (blonde ale with clean and well balanced flavor). I think it's really fun that all of the beer names play off the Punch Buggy namesake. The Love Bug Hazelnut, although not my favorite of the three, had the most interesting flavor. Definitely  something to try even if Hazelnut isn't your thing. \n\nMy boyfriend read somewhere that when asked whether or not this brewery was going to be serving food that their response was something along the lines of \"Yes, we'll have food, but we'll be focusing mostly on artisanal grilled cheese.\" If that's not what was said, and I'm taking y'all out of context, I'm sorry, but that response had my boyfriend and I headed down to check y'all out for sure just based on the grilled cheese. \n\nWe got the Jalapeño grilled cheese as well as the pepperoni grilled cheese and I will say that the Jalapeño was just a tad bit better. The combination of the cheeses (which I would actually suggest that you print which cheeses you're using for each grilled cheese on the menu, because I didn't see that they were listed and have no idea what cheeses were on the sandwiches even though they were great) and the jalapeño flavor with a kick was amazing. I liked the Pepperoni Pizza grilled cheese, but I would've liked it more if it had bigger slices of pepperoni in it. I understand why they chopped up the pep, (so that you'd be more likely to have every bite have the flavor) but I feel like it diminished the presence of the flavor overall. I wouldn't say to use the deli sized pep, but maybe the smaller ones, because the pepperoni flavor was barely there. Pretty good, but sadly barely there.  \n\nWe also had the Black Bean Chipotle Hummus and it was hands down top three hummuses that I've had in my entire life. The heat hits you like 4-5 seconds into chewing the chip and the flavor profile is insanely unique for hummus. The only suggestion I would have would be to up the game on the chip pairing. The Tortilla chips were not on the same level as the godliness that is that hummus. The saltiness of the tortilla chips took away from the flavor of the hummus (which was neutral at first and then hit you with the heat) maybe some stronger tortilla chips or some unsalted pita chips would be a better pairing. \n\nOverall the vibe of this place was pretty chill, and I'll surely be back. I can really see this brewery as the place that everyone loves to come hang out at on Tuesdays for trivia or something like that. Also their Hoppy Buggy logo is amazing. Super awesome.

Like, if you're lactose intolerant, this would be one of those times that's your risk it for the biscuit just to to taste these bad boys. Totally worth it, I was blown away. All for $7.50.

The Love bills itself as a neighborhood restaurant, and it would be, perhaps, the platonic ideal of that if the prices dropped by a third.

I usually stay in Center City but all the hotels in the area were sold out because of the Equality Forum. I scored a decent rate of $120/night + tax through Expedia.\n\nIn any event, I enjoyed the overall vibe of the place. I checked in around 2:30pm. I was greeted by the handsome, energetic front desk clerk and directed to room 225.\n\nWhile room 225 was definitely one of the larger rooms in the hotel, there's a reason for that. It was a double room designed for someone who uses a wheelchair. I was only staying one night so I didn't bother making a big fuss about it, but I did enjoy the larger size. Some of the accessibility \"extras\", like everything being REALLY low for easier access, took some getting used to. The bathroom area was equally huge, with easy access to the sink and closet area, as well as a water closet and roll-in shower tucked behind a huge sliding door. The shower itself had one of those detachable shower heads as well as a gym-shower style dispenser with body wash and shampoo. \n\nAs for the bed, other than being ridiculously low to the floor (again, for easier access for those in wheelchairs), it was pretty comfortable and I slept pretty soundly. The TV had a decent selection of HDTV channels. Complementary water and coffee was in the room, as well as a mini-fridge in the bathroom area in case you wanted to keep drinks or meds cool. \n\nThe parking fee was $9 with in/out privileges. You had to get a new ticket every time you entered and the front desk would stamp it when you wanted to leave the lot. The lot is pretty large and shared with two other Sheraton properties (They also run a shared shuttle in case you're going to or from the airport.).  \n\nI took a quick look at the pool area. It was pretty empty but again, it's early May and that's to be expected, I guess. There's not much choices for food onsite, other than a quick-service area that's a tad overpriced (again, to be expected). You can drive north maybe 5 minutes on Island Avenue for fast food if you needed to. The bar area looked fun, but again, it was pretty empty for a Saturday.\n\nAll in all, if I had to stay outside of Center City Philadelphia again, I'd probably stay here.

One for women and one for men - which leaves you with no privacy if you want to change and shower at your leisure.  There's nothing calming about waiting for the change room to free up or rushing to change or shower so someone else can get in. (what is this, a YMCA?)  On busy weekends, the waiting areas tend to fill up too - so it can get a little 'packed'.\n\nLastly, some of the esthesticians have a tendency to really push their products - which I hate and find annoying especially when I'm already spending good money getting a treatment - - so buyer beware, as the line of products they carry are pretty expensive.\n\nBut cons, aside, I'll still go back to Rescue and look forward to trying out other treatments.", "p": ["Day Spas", "Beauty & Spas", "Skin Care", "Massage Therapy"], "n": ["Hair Salons"]}, {"business_id": "VD4Rdyj0tauBckrTYgIcpQ", "name": "The Concourse at Comcast Center", "date": "2009-06-09 17:29:21", "stars": 2.0, "text": "Sheesh.

Regardless of how perfect a dining experience is, it's always a little painful to fork out over $600 (with tip) for a meal for two. Go with someone you love (or someone else that will pick up the tab, unless that's one and the same) who is not a picky eater (aside: is there anything worse than a picky eater?) and that has a real appreciation for vino.\n\nWhen you go here, you have to go all out.  Since you're shelling it out already, you might as well go full steam ahead.  Go for the Grand tasting menu with the grand wine pairings that will seriously blow your mind.  To be honest, I almost enjoyed the wine more than I did the food (more on that, later).  The staff here are so well-versed in their wine selections, it was a pleasure to hear them describe each pairing with detail and authority.  Once you are able to marry both that wine and the food, you know you have arrived.\n\nThe highlights, are, of course as everyone says, the pasta.  Rich, but light, earthy, fresh, buttery, and oh so succulent.  It takes everything in your body and good upbringing to restrain yourself from scarfing it down in two bites (although the portions are just that, two to three bites worth - or five to six conservative bites).\n\nEverything here is well-conceived, perfectly executed and beautifully presented.  The staff is a dream.  Everything from the amuse-bouche, to the meal procession, wine service, pre-dessert, dessert and send-off is effortless and lovely.  And for that price tag, it should be.\n\nThis meal never had a low point for me, the preparation, taste and execution was consistent, right down to the fudge they send home with you.  The truly high point of the meal, are the Grand wine pairings.  Simply put: out of this world.   Maybe, that is the true test of master chef, a menu where the food and wine dance impeccably together and bring the best out of each other.  However, there were times where the wine clearly outshone the food, both in complexity and depth - and I often wanted more of the wine than I did of the food -- and I cannot believe that's the intended reaction a chef would like me to have (putting my obvious love of wine, aside, I do love food more).\n\nSo including that, the other things which are holding me back from awarding Vetri the full five stars that it definitely deserves in the grand scheme of Philadelphia restaurants are that for starters-  at the price point that Vetri charges, I would have appreciated a couple extra courses, and perhaps a palate cleanser half-way through the meal would have been nice as well.  I had no problem with the portion sizes or the duration of the dinner, but when pre-dessert came, I was not ready for the meal to be over.  I thought I deserved and paid for just a little more.  Also, as I noted in the beginning, in a town where gourmet eateries of Vetri's caliber are offering similar fare but at a more affordable cost, shouldn't Vetri strive to offer more or offer what they have to cost a little less?  My two cents.\n\nEither way, a worthy Philly dining experience.

The whole time that B&B was Liberties, I came to the place only a handful of times.  The reason?  Not quite sure, except that I felt that for all the beauty the place had, it didn't have much of a heart or a personality, or that something that would make me want to come back.  In a neighborhood, filled with places that are neighborhood places with a loyal clientele and a certain je-ne-sais-quoi-, this place never seemed to get its footing or become the place that it could (should?) be.\n\nEven now, I stil feel like B&B might be overzealous and overambitious in its approach. First, the menu is WAY too big - wayyy too many items on there. There are a bunch of sandwiches, home-y, comfort food, plates and pizzas, too?  That is way too much.  I understand the intent, a menu to please all palates and offer all things, but a menu can't always be everything to everyone, and when it does that, it will always fall short in its execution.

I stuck to a whiskey as I thought I should, and the bartender suggested one for my bourbon/whiskey neophyte self.

Yes, the freshly-squeezed OJ and yes, the food IS good.\n\nBut is Honey's the place of the second-coming of god-ly-eateries? NO.  Is this the brunch place to end all brunch places? NO.

Grabbed a menu and brought it home. It looked like they had a lot of vegan and gluten free options and even encourages you to customize the menu, so my roommate and I decided to order dinner from here! We called 1 hour to close (we live a few blocks away) and while I can't remember what she ordered, I know that I got the BLT + A. Everything was fine and dandy until we got there and realized it's cash only (I know, I'm one of those people but it's 2017! Come on!) So my roommate goes to take out cash and I noticed the bill was incredibly high. I asked to look at the receipt and see we were charged an EXTRA $2 for EACH sandwich for the avocado. I asked the woman at the front what that was for, and she pointed to a sign on the counter that said that avocado would be a $2 upcharge because of demand or something like that. So, let me tell you that both sandwiches are ALREADY made with avocado, with mine having \"avocado\" in the name. How are you going to charge $2 for a few slices of avocado on a $6 sandwich? That makes no sense. I would understand if I added avocado to an existing sandwich that didn't already have one, but the $6 price already reflects the cost of the avocado. My second qualm here is that when we called, WE WERE NEVER TOLD OF THE UPCHARGE! I would have gotten something else with no issue. \n\nWhen both of these points were raised to the extremely rude worker at the front, she scowled and gave myself and my roommate and attitude. I asked for the manager and she said that they were not there and \"even if they were here, they would say the same thing.\" Words cannot describe how incredibly rude this woman/girl...I'll call her a girl...was to us. No \"I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. Unfortunately this is our current policy. I'd be happy to remove the avocado for you if you wouldn't like to pay\" or anything pleasant of the sort! We left without the food. \n\nSo that was the one bad apple. However, I decided to give it another try yesterday morning because I really do love gluten free and vegan foods. This experience was significantly better. I essentially took like 5 things off of the menu in other items and created my own \"concoction\" and they were very accommodating and helpful! They even made the thing look pretty, too! \n\nOverall, I think I will be back...just not at night when that awful person is there.

The waitstaff at this location proved to be a bit more green by forgetting two of our requests.  While they were upbeat and meant well, I was sorely disappointed by their lack of knowledge about the cuisine.  When asked why the dish was called \"dry pot\" style, the waiter responded \"I really don't know, my best guess is because it has dry peppers and is made in a pot.\"  Even if that is the right answer, customers shouldn't receive a best guess.  Thus my docking the restaurant a point.  Even though Han has never been known for his bedside manner, he has always prioritized the food and his waitstaff should do the same.\n\nThe food is scrumptious and consistent with the other locations.  My recommendations are unfortunately generic - beef and tripe in chili oil and the dan dan noodles.  Stick with the authentic dishes and you can't go wrong.  I will say that I am not a fan of the americanized Chinese dishes, finding them too sweet.  As a whole, the food is a bit small portioned for its price.\n\nRandom thought - While the ornate metal tea pots are beautiful, I don't know that it is enough to compensate for how difficult they are to maneuver.", "p": [], "n": ["Restaurants", "Chinese", "Szechuan"]}, {"business_id": "HTqXI5S2XcSlh_ylx9sE6g", "name": "Termini Bros Bakery", "date": "2010-11-04 15:04:44", "stars": 1.0, "text": "I am not quite sure why there are always such rave reviews for this place....I have never found that their cakes match the reviews.\n\nTaste:  I got one of their classic layer cakes and was sorely disappointed with its taste.

They are nice enough when you know what you want to order, but they are not too helpful in providing recommendations.  When I asked for help the woman responded with a very lackadaisical attitude - she wasn't excited about making a sale nor the cakes she is selling.

It felt cozy-ish within an industrial type building.  The whole place smelled like banana bread (why is that?).  The female bathrooms were okay but the men's bathrooms were pretty dirty and smelled.  The tables don't seem to be cleared off too well (or perhaps it is because as soon as someone stands up, another group snags their table), so you might have to deal with a tabletop that isn't quite clean or dry.\n\nService:  Everyone who works there was upbeat and very accommodating.  The people up at the front are cheerful and upbeat.  They greet you and give you tokens to await for the next beer tour.  The woman who actually gave the tour was nice enough and tried to provide some insider jokes, but she didn't seem like she really knew everything nor was she a very compelling speaker.  It is very nice that they give you three small tastings of beer (one at the front door and two on the tour) for free.\n\nProvisions:  The sample beers were okay, not cold on account of sitting out - but that was okay with me.  My tourmates and I stayed after the tour for some additional beers, which were good - but it did take quite a lot of waiting at the bar in order to get the drinks.  Whether there was table service or not is unbeknownst to me, so we didn't get anything to eat.\n\nOverall:  The tour was pretty short and since you don't get to see any moving parts, so I probably wouldn't go on it again.

I walked in and ordered a spicy chicken from the super awesome Blake F.... this is how it went down\n\nI pushed open the screen door and my senses were overloaded in fried goodness. My life seemed rather dull and lusterless before inhaling the medley of donuts and chicken.  A familiar face was at the counter and beaming her winning smile.  \n\n\"Hey buddy, good to see you!\" I said.\n\"Hey there, welcome!\" she replied.\nI could barely contain my hunger at this point. If I wouldn't look insane for licking the sweet air, I would have.\n\"Can I get the spicy chicken?\" I said.  God knows I love everything spicy and fortunately, luck was on my side.\n\"You bet, 1 spicy\" she commanded.\n\nI paid and waited for my chicken.  As I was admiring the simple establishment that has nailed the adage, \"Do a few things VERY well instead of a lot of things crappily,\" an old timer walked up and adjusted his worn cover.

Also, most groups are large so check the bill because tip is probably added. \n-Knock on the front door! It's at the corner of intersecting side streets (Gaskill and Leithgow). Since it's just off of South st I'm sure they lock the door to keep the trash out. \n\nOkay, so first, anyone who comes to the city to visit me generally gets a trip here. Why? Because I've never had a bad experience. The service is always culturally reserved yet friendly. The food is always outstanding. For the chicken I always recommend the spicy. if you have a mixed group (some don't like spicy) you can get the olive base and ask for a side of spicy sauce. For the choice of kabobs or lamb, they are both excellent, just pick your kill. The bastilla (the 2nd dish pound of pastry). It is is my favorite and always super hot so break it apart before diving in to the devilishly delicious blend. \n\nI've had a date here and really enjoyed it and I've had a birthday party with over 20 people and the experience was just as awesome. During my birthday, we probably brought 15 bottles of wine (no comments please...) and the waiters kept coming over to make sure we had plenty of water and kept uncorking for us. We brought one young baby who slept most of the time but she started crying (though briefly) and the owner offered to take her for a moment because mom was eating and he actually rocked her! She stopped crying and he gave her back to mom. He absolutely DIDN'T have to do that, but they are just that friendly there. (It helps I go often, so he recognizes us). Another member of our party mentioned she is allergic to nuts, so they actually baked her a mini bastilla without nuts, yet another nice touch. \n\nThe ambiance of this place is great, it's 3 stories of segregated dens, some larger than others. I do recommend getting reservations, especially on weekends because they only have a few seatings a night - remember you're there for all those courses.

We sat in the restaurant area since I'm underage, but I liked the atmosphere. Our waitress was really nice as well.\n My dad liked the beer and I liked the food. I got the pulled pork sandwich with collard greens. The portions were huge. I've never had barbeque made with vinegar sauce but I really liked it. For dessert, I ordered the Red Velvet Cupcake. Now, I'm from Southern California and I have tried red velvet before, but I couldn't understand what the fuss was about. I decided to give it another try since I was on the east coast. Best. Decision. Ever. I finally understood what Red Velvet is supposed to taste like. It was delicious!

She was (*gasp* ) very attentive for an Ethiopian restaurant waitress.  The service was not as good quick as the average non-Ethiopian restaurant, but it definitely blew all the Ethiopian restaurant services away with the speed!  Gee, I wonder if it could be because she's not Ethiopian?!?!?!  hahaha  However, she did mention that she grew up in West Philly eating Ethiopian food.  mmmm I'm jealous!  \n\nAs is my custom, I went to use the bathroom and wash my hands before the meal.  Considering that Ethiopian food is eaten with one's hands, I would highly recommend this practice to all my friends .  There were two \"stalls\" in the bathroom.  Both stalls have saloon styled doors (2 halves swinging freely in the middled, hinged on either side).  The first one was lit, but the right half of the door was missing.  Given this, I opted for the second stall.  After stepping inside, I noticed a good 2 inches between the halves of the door.  Needless to say, I did my business in a hurry all the while praying that no one else would come in.  PLEASE LADIES, GO TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT.  It is a harrowing experience!\n\nWhen the food came (sooner than expected), the portions were fairly generous.  When I bit into the injera at the Queen of Sheba, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was fairly sour!  It was not as sour as Abyssinia's injera, but definitely a few steps more sour than anywhere else I have tried up to date.  Now, I'm not saying ideal injera should be sour, but I like mine that way.   hahaha  Unfortunately parts of the injera were a little dried.  *sigh*   It's a toss up for me between dried injera versus more sour injera.   \n\nThe dishes were all decent, but not amazing.  My companion liked the potatoes in the carrot, string bean, potato dish.  I thought their salad was fabulous - fresh and dressed perfectly.  I did not care for the raw onions, but have to admit the taste was a nice contrast to the other dishes.  Both lentil dishes were decent, as I have said before it is difficult for me to tell much of a difference in them.  However, my trusty sidekick noted that the lentils were more watery at Kaffa Crossing.  I know that 1 of the lentil dishes was too spicy for me, but I am a big, Big wuss when it comes to spices, so that is neither here nor there.

She had it before in Morocco and wanted to see what this restaurant was like. \n\nThis place is right off of South street, which made for some difficulty parking. However, we decided on a late dinner at 7:15pm or so, and so got lucky with close parking spots. The service was super duper friendly, although not extremely fast. This did not really bother us as I get the impression that Moroccan culture makes a meal a slow experience in itself. Although we found out later that all our servers and even the owner were not Moroccan. However, do not worry, the chef is (and is not that the most important part? hahaha). \n\nWe had coupons so we had to order the Fez Feast (7 courses). We started out with a trio of cold salads. They were all very good. There was a cucumber salad, a carrot salad and eggplant concoction. This was served with all you can eat warm bread, which was delicious. The servers bring by the bread in this gigantic woven basket; I felt a bit bad on how often I asked them to bring us bread, but it really was delicious. Then we had a puff pastry with a meat like mixture. I have to admit neither I nor my companion really cared for this. The dish was sprinkled with powdered sugar, and meat and powdered sugar just did not work for me. \n\nWe both had the olive lemon chicken (I think you had a choice of several different types of chicken, but it was hard to understand the server). The chicken was fairly tender, but the dish overall was too salty for me. The server asked if we would like it mild or spicy and we decided on mild. However, he made the ingenious suggestion of getting the spices on the side so we could at least try it. The server informed me that there was harissa in the spices, which is an ingredient I have been dying to try. The spices ended up being too spicy for me, but I was really glad to have gotten the chance to try the harissa, and the flavor was quite good. \n\nThe fourth course was a choice between beef kabobs and honey almond lamb. My companion and I ended up split over this choice; she got the kabobs and I got the lamb. She was generous enough to allow me to try her kabob, which consisted of green peppers, onions (I think) and 3 chunks of beef. I did not really think it was anything special. It did not really seem specially seasoned or flavored. The lamb, however, was quite tasty. I was a little disappointed as the lamb was not super tender and the honey taste did not seem really infused into the meat. But overall, it was a pretty tasty dish. I had this same (I believe) dish YEARS ago after finishing my first year of undergraduate education. I remembered it being amazing. Of course that was years ago, and memories get warped throughout the years. So I liked this dish but was a bit disappointed because it did not live up to the memories. \n\nThe fifth dish was a couscous with roasted vegetables. There is not much to say. It was okay, a bit bland, but okay. I know my companion thought it was a bit too dry. There were a lot of good vegetables in there, however. \n\nI am not sure how they counted the last few courses. There was fruit that was brought to us in a basket. A generous 6 pieces; two each of apples, bananas and oranges. It does not sound like much, but considering how much food preceded this, we were full just looking at the fruit. There was also a very, very delicious cup of sweetened mint tea. This was followed by an eclair looking pastry. I found the pastry to be a great light and sweet ending to the meal. \n\nMy biggest complaint and word of caution is that later at night it seems like a lot of customers come for the hookah. Since I am allergic to smoke and the dining area is one big long room with nowhere to hide, this was a problem. I would say, if you think that the hookah will bother you to come earlier in the evening. When we first got to the restaurant, there was traditional Moroccan sounding music playing, later when the hookah customers came, the music all of a sudden changed to a disco-techy musical selection. I guess they think hookah goes better with disco-techy music. Hahaha", "p": [], "n": ["Hookah Bars"]}]}

After we had already left the restuarant, the waitress comes out shouting, \"excuse me,\" and we turn around thinking, \"what did we forget?\" And she said \"This one tipped, but THAT ONE didn't. Are you going to tip?\" We explained to her the scenario and she didn't let up. She asked AGAIN if we'd tip more, out in the streets of chinatown, like a beggar. As if a dollar or two would really hurt her day. As if she's entitled to the money in our wallet. Then the next time we came in, she didn't help us, naturally, but she told her coworker about what happened last time. After we got our check, this new waitress left, we were in the middle of calculating the tip, and she said \"You don't need to do that, it's all at the bottom of the receipt, see? The math is done for you.\"\n\nFirst of all, thanks for acting like we've never seen a check before, but insulting a customer definitely won't benefit you. Understand this: handing us a bowl of soup, taking it back, not pouring us water, and leaving us until we have to call you for the check does not mean you need an extremely high tip, nor does it mean you really need one at all. It's a privilege to get a tip, not an entitlement. Other countries actually don't even allow for tips to be distributed, so be lucky for every cent you get. Not everyone believes in tipping - for me, it has to be earned, and that's that. Don't chase me out of the restaurant, breathe down my throat, and give me an attitude like the spoiled brat you are. You won't last long if that's the case. Besides, our tip was actually for the only MALE waiter who actually helped us out, not you, girl.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love the food at Terakawa and one or two rotten employees won't stop us from coming back. Just don't expect tips for nothing from me. My money is not automatically yours just because you do what's in your JOB DESCRIPTION.

My fiancée and I were so excited at the lengthy tea menu they provided, we actually had two different teas each.\n\nWe started off with two bubble milk teas, iced and hot.

We continued with waffles with green tea ice cream and fruit as our dessert. Not bad, but probably won't order it again.

On a recent weekend trip to Philly, we stayed at the Hotel Monaco, parked our car, and enjoyed the area. Because our weekend was packed with family events, Red Owl offered a place for us to stop in for a quick bite or drink, without the stuffy hotel bar/restaurant feel.  \n\nIn a three day period, we somehow managed to experience happy hour, drinks, and brunch. The charcuterie platter was substantial and thoughtfully crafted, the perfect pair to a locally brewed pint. Also recommended: the donuts.\n\nBrunch menu items range from healthy to traditional; the potatoes are delicious. Note that the bloody marys are chock full of horseradish--I enjoy a spicy bloody, but we had to order extra tomato juice to balance the flavor.\n\nAll in all, Red Owl took the guesswork out of navigating the neighborhood between events, offering variety and friendly service to keep us coming back.", "p": ["Breakfast & Brunch", "Restaurants"], "n": []}]}

Someday I'l try one of their paninis or vegan sweets and see if they are worthy of a fifth star.  \n\nOne time I stupidly spilled a large portion of my drink while trying to add cream and sugar  with the same hand I was using to hold a dog leash(did I mention you can take your doggie here).  The dog pulled and coffee went everywhere.  Fail.  The baristas were so nice, they didn't get mad at me, helped me clean up and refilled my coffee.

Usually my husband and I avoid busy restaurants on Fridays and Saturdays and opt for a Thursday date night, we have also sworn off Valentine's Day and any other amateur hour/prix fixe/everyone is out type of night. We were still clinging to restaurant week, but have been let down on so many occasions.  Bummer. \n\nWe started off with drinks, and there is something off about the drinks here. I can't place it, but they just taste awful, and we had three different drinks. The worst was the blood orange martini. It tasted so flat and bland and almost watered down. The Pepino, the jalapeño/cucumber/basil beverage should have been packed with flavor, but fell flat with just heat and little actual taste. It was the best of the three. I then tried the cherry grand marnier drink, can't remember the name as recommended by the manager--again it fell flat and though it had been described to me as \"sweet\" it was not at all. I could taste the alcohol hardcore, but little else. I suspect they are using low quality tequilas and charging top shelf prices, but that's just my theory. \n\nWe placed our order-- guac that we customized, cheese empanadas, mexican flatbread, two vegetable sopas and the churros and chocolate tres leches cake for dessert. Our guac arrived and again, I only tasted the heat of the habanero that we had requested. We also asked for spanish onions, roasted garlic and tomatoes. I have made better guacamole whilst drunk. BLAND city. I even squeezed a lime in it form my drink to brighten the flavor, nothing. It was also way too smooth, like they had a vat of pureed avocado in the back and were just adding things in quickly. The chips also needed more salt. \n\nNext, we received our entrees instead of our apps. When the guy (not our waiter) put them down in front of us we were all \"nope, didn't get apps yet\" and he was all ok, bye and left the entrees there. Uh what? The manager did come over and apologize and offer us a free drink for the mistake, encourage us to eat meal in reverse. We did, and it kind of ruined the whole night since we filled up like crazy on the heavy entree. We then waited quite some time for our apps. The empanadas were the only amazing part of the meal. The flatbread had an odd mouthfeel to it, was greasy and again lacked flavor. We waited awhile again for our desserts and our waiter was mostly MIA for the entire meal.  Finally dessert. The churros were not fully cooked. The oil was obviously too hot because they outsides were crispy and brown, but they were pure uncooked batter inside. Gross. This was confirmed by the table next to us, as theirs were also partially raw. The cake was yummy. Subpar meal, bad drinks, kind of crappy service.

It is always a shock once you get to the register.

I think we did him proud.  \n\nI guess I'll get my disclaimer/four star explanation out of the way and say Honey's did disappoint me once when the waitress or maybe the kitchen totally forgot to flip the ticket to see my Mom's lone omelet on the other side.  We had a table of five and only four of us got our food but they rushed her breakfast and got it out pretty fast.  It figures, had to be the time I took my Mom to the place I rave about.

At some point you must try a latke here. Seriously amazing.  Oh and the chocolate cake, which is rich and big enough to share does not disappoint.  \n\nThe main problem you'll have here is figuring out what to order.

The shows here are amazing, I wish I could review the upstairs separately. \n\nNow let's get down to why I hate it here: the dining area.  I'm not sure that I have ever had a good experience here in the four or so years I've been going but JB's proximity to my house has caused to me to continue trying.  This past Friday was the last straw.  I was hungry and meeting my husband for an after work beer.  It had been a while since we'd eaten here so the memories of shitty service were repressed and buried deep down in my brain.    A few of our friends met us and we were seated in a booth- much to my friend Kelly's dismay as she prefers to sit and eat at the bar, a mantra I will now follow.  \n\nWe sat and ordered a second round of drinks.  My husband ordered a second Kenzinger.  It came and he tasted it proclaiming it did not taste like a Kenzinger or it tasted like the lines were dirty.  A friend at the table tasted it and agreed.  When our waitress returned he let her know and she argued with him that Kenzinger tastes bad, asking had he ever had one before.  We explained that he ordered one at the lower bar and it tasted fine (and that he likes Kenzinger and maybe you shouldn't talk shit on a local beer that  you serve in your bar asshole)  but since this beer came from the upper bar that maybe the lines were dirty or something else was off.  She kept arguing with him even questioning if his first order had been a Lionshead and not a Kenzinger before she finally took it away and got him something different.   WHY ARGUE?!? What point are you proving here? Just shut the eff up and take it back.  Seriously it's like they train people to be shitty servers here.  \n\nSo on to the food- it was fine but hot damn if it's not expensive and lacking in portion size and taste for the prices.  The menu seems to have expanded lately, which makes me really happy save for the fact that the prices are a little ridiculous.  The sides board lists collard greens, brussels sprouts and spinach for $5.50 each.  What? I was half  tempted to order one just to see the portion size.  I opted for the vegetable focaccia.  It was good, with goat cheese, roasted peppers, eggplant and squash.  It was also a pretty big portion for $7.  I also ordered the smashed potatoes- very tasty.  I got pretty lucky with my crazy people dinner.  My husband had an $8 grilled cheese- nothing special and it was served with a tiny little portion of potato chips.  The menu is written on a chalk board so there are no explanations for any of the food.  I kind of hate this a lot.  I know it's better for the environment and it's easy to erase or add something from a board but I just hate that I am required to speak to the wait staff any more than necessary.  \n\nOk so to top off our awesome experience my friend ordered dessert to go.  She opted for the hazelnut cheesecake.  It came out in a large tin container along with the check.  We all marveled at it swimming around in the container.  It was, with no exaggeration smaller than a post-it note and it was $5.  We were all \"hell no\" and once the waitress returned we requested it be taken back and off of the bill.  Another argument ensued.  Wow.  The waitress \"explained\" that the cheesecake was very rich and so the portions were smaller.  My friend held her debit card next to the slice and showed the waitress how the debit card was larger than the slice.   I have no idea how you even get a slice of cheesecake to be that small, seriously, how does one cut a slice so small? Or was it made in a teeny tiny spring form pan? \n\nSo in summation (sorry it was so long but I do love to bitch!) go here for a pint, upstairs for a show with gorgeous sound or food at the bar only unless you're in the mood for an argument.", "p": [], "n": ["Bars", "Restaurants", "Wine & Spirits", "Nightlife"]}, {"business_id": "EzjysPg2-lVX1E0ibStUXw", "name": "Ekta Indian Cuisine", "date": "2012-06-27 15:40:20", "stars": 4.0, "text": "I'm sorry Ekta.

The first order came out in about 5 minutes which was amazing. 10 minutes went by, then 15, and our server didn't even come over to see how our first dish was, just stood in the corner chatting. We got another servers attention after 20 minutes of waiting and let him know we were still waiting on our order. We also advised him that if it wasn't ready, to forget about it and we would share the first one. He came back and told us that it would be out any second. Another ten minutes went by, still no dish, still nothing from our original server. We let the young man know that we were no longer interested in the dish that was 25 minutes late, and then our original server finally decided to come over! Could you believe the first thing she said was \"so im hearing that you never got the second batch of fries?\". As if it was some kind of rumor. Then had the nerve to ask if we still wanted it. She took it off the bill but I was extremely disappointed with the service, and will certainly not return the next time I am in town. Especially since I got sick in the middle of the night from it.

And I guess that the kids these days like piano bars.\n\nAside from the piano aspect (which is a welcome change in the club scene), this place is a dump.

I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.\nSo strike 1 is the rude staff in a \"MAJOR\" hotel!\n\n2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). \nSo Strike 2 is in a \"MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!\n\n3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. \nSo strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a \"MAJOR\" hotel!\n\n4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a \"MAJOR\" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.\nSo Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a \"MAJOR\" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.\n\n5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!\nStrike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!\n\n6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.\nStrike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.\n\nAll of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone!

I came here after a friend recommended it and was super stoked to try it out.  I even read reviews before arriving (in true Yelper form) and was even more thrilled about my reservation because of the 4 and 5 star write ups.  My experience was not pleasant.  Not even close.  The service was bad and the food was mediocre at best.  \n\nReservations were for a Friday night.  With wine in tow, I arrived, opened the door and was immediately standing over someone's entree.  Cool. As my date and I stood there waiting to be seated I felt like I was in some weird basement sushi frat party. Tightly packed with zero elbow room.  Dimly lit with weird purple/blue lighting but not dark enough that I didn't notice the metal folding chairs at the tables. What? Metal folding chairs? Is this a 4th of July picnic at weird Aunt Nancy's crib in Northeast Philly? \n\nOnce we were seated and I was finished judging the interior, I decided to put it all behind me and focus on the food -which, I had plenty of time to do since our order wasn't taken for about 20+ minutes.  Finally, once we got some attention, we decided going sharesies with a few regular rolls and two specialty rolls: the Temple Roll and Ten Street roll.  The Temple had spicy yellowtail, tempura flakes wrapped in black peppered seared white tuna with some sweet sauce. It was good but nothing exceptional- and, sadly, it was the better of the two special rolls we ordered.  \n\nWait, TWO special rolls? Yes. This is the conversation I had to have with the waitress since only one was brought out.  Once the order was finally corrected our Ten Street roll arrived and it looked unappetizing.  On the menu its described as deep fried tuna, salmon, yellowtail and white fish, finished with unagi sauce, massgo, scallion and spicy mayo.  Should be described as: gross.  It was overcooked and I could definitely taste the old (and probably unchanged) oil from their fryer.   I normally stay far away from cooked maki rolls but I've had some pretty stellar deep fried rolls in my time and this one didn't even come close.  It was foul.  Aside from being burnt and small, it tasted like Bumblebee canned tuna and was smothered in sauces. Needless to say, after waiting 30 minutes for it after we placed our original order- I was peeved. \n\nDuring our dinner service was inattentive. Maybe it was because the restaurant was busy or perhaps they were all in the back putting out what smelled like a small grease fire for the last 15 minutes of our meal complete with smoke that started to make its way into the dining room. More burnt Ten Street canned Bumblebee tuna rolls for everyone?", "p": [], "n": ["Restaurants", "Japanese", "Sushi Bars"]}]}

For a mere $5 you get 6 pieces of bruschetta loaded with perfectly seasoned tomatoes. I really enjoyed this. We then each ordered a bacon cheeseburger. This was probably my least favorite aspect of the meal. While the bacon was crisp, the roll fresh, and the tomato juicy, the burger itself left much to be desired. I asked for mine cooked medium and there was not a speck of pink. It tasted very dull and not juicy. In addition, we split an order of chicken fingers. They were good, but nothing special. A lot more of the bready coating than actual chicken. These came with fries which were slightly undercooked and undersalted. However, we also ordered a personal margarita pizza. This was just as good as the bruschetta. The sauce was the perfect mix of savory and sweet. The mozzarella tasted extremely fresh. The crust was delicious as well, crispy, yet chewy.

I think this is a great choice if you have never dined at Suraya before or aren't familiar wIth Lebanese food. It includes a variety of dips to pair with the house made pita. These dips/spreads can be used on various other courses over the evening. My personal favorite was the labneh which is a yogurt based spread; it is rich and creamy with a unique flavor. The baba ganoush was also excellent. Each person then chooses another \"mezza\" (appetizer)--definitely an advantage of dining with a larger group here as you get to try more! My favorite was the fatteh which is a chickpea dish. This is honestly incredible with both sweet and savory flavors. \n\nFor an entree, I chose the kawarama.

My kawarma was cooked perfectly and paired well with the dill yogurt and pomegranate salad it was served with.  The final part of the meal was dessert.

The only negative I've experienced  is getting through by phone, but I know from experience that you can expect that to be a problem with any U of Pennsylvania-affiliated practice. \nMy search for an MD had the following criteria: Board certified in internal med or family practice, multiple physician office, Pennsylvania Hospital affiliation since all my records are there, personal referral from at least 3 sources (including a patient & a health professional),  50 years old or younger (for being up-to-date and so i won't outlive her worklife).  Then I made appts w 3 docs for initial visit and personal impression. I chose Dr Nizen after that extensive search.  \nThe office is clean, the staff are courteous and efficient; she does my Pap smear & breast exam.  She is very focused - if I make an appt for one issue, eg Pap exam, and bring up something else that seems important, we choose together which one has priority for that day & I make a later appt for the other.  I keep a running list of everything of concern & bring the list with me when I see her - I'm 68, with multiple health issues & she tracks them accurately & often asks about something not on my list. I'm a very satisfied patient.   I saw Dr Mazzotti the only time Dr Nizen was unavailable for an urgent issue & she too was focused and competent.  \nThey have e-mail access to make appts or ask a non-urgent question - that's convenient.   .

I was thrilled to see the The Shade Store opened in Philly.  I had walked by the one in NYC often but never had time to go in.  Unfortunately, at the Philly store, the customer service was horrible. We wanted cordless shades and their were such limited options. Plus, the mounting hardware on all of their shades looked cheap and was highly visible compared to other options I have seen elsewhere.  Even the pictures in their catalog look pretty bad when you check out the details of how they are hung.\n\nThe person who waited on us lacked so much product knowledge she had to traipse across the floor looking up answers online and calling supervisors for every single question we had.  She would forget the kind of shade we were looking for and give us misinformation, walk us down a design path and then 15 minutes into planning tell us she was wrong and we could not do it.  After an hour of dealing with this woman, she finally told us to just go online at home because she couldn't figure out how to use their website and couldn't answer any more of our questions about the shades we were going to order.  My god, why have a brick and mortar store if you are just going to tell people to go online and use your website?\n\nI got home, went online, and discovered that we were unable to purchase her suggested cordless roller shades in the size we need.  I'm not sure why their are such stringent size limitations but they won't make cordless roller shades under 35\" wide.  I want cordless for aesthetic reasons, but many people want them for safety with children.  These folks need to get with the program.  \n\nInstead of using The Shade Store, I went with Drapery Design in Paoli.  Yes, it is far away, but they can come to your home for consultation and installation.  Their shades and drapes are handmade to order and their range of fabrics is much more extensive.  Plus, they had no problem working with my measurements.  The shades now hanging in my home are more substantial and higher quality than The Shade Store, were a bit less expensive, and the woman who we worked with knew the industry and her products inside and out. \n\nThe Shade Store gets two stars because they are made in the USA, otherwise, this would be a one-star review.", "p": ["Shades & Blinds"], "n": ["Shades & Blinds"]}, {"business_id": "-OIUunijjcq_ZzyyQhPPFQ", "name": "Zorba's Taverna", "date": "2013-12-23 05:36:52", "stars": 2.0, "text": "Don't do it.

Then with food left and mid-bite suddenly our waiter decided he was ready to pay attention to us and asked to clear our plates.

I think it's sin is that I trusted them to lead me through a culinary experience... after all it was on their menu to try a five course meal.  But I am getting ahead of myself.\n\nWanted to try something new we hit the little strip near the Open Air Market in Old City. As is the norm when I visit there it was snowing. We showed up reservation-less at Xochitl and were \"greeted\" by an angry hipster who clearly didn't think we deserved to be there.  Ok - no reservation - but we were also the second to last table seated that night... and there were several open tables... including SEVERAL that would have been much nicer than the one we got... but I digress.\n\nThe menu looked good - if maybe lacking in description.  It was clear this was because the wait staff wanted to tell us about the preparations.  We ordered the 5 course deal - for me it was guacamole made at the table, A trio of tamales, a tuna ceviche, the Aztec skirt steak, and a dessert to be named later.\n\nNow - I'll point out before I continue - I'm a white boy... but I'm a white boy who lived in Texas for a few years.  I may not be able to pronounce this stuff - but I now what it all is... and I don't think I would have navigated this menu AT ALL if I hadn't known what it all was.  But I digress.\n\nGuac came out first.  Apparently \"made to order at the table\" means \"prepared at the table\" as I felt it needed more salt and probably peppers if my date was ok with the heat - but old boy folded up his dish tray before I got to find out how it was.  But it was while we were waiting for the guac that the first real taste of this chef came out - a complimentary taste of scallop on watermelon.  Very complex, very tasty. The cooked watermelon took on an almost sour quality that paired well with whatever they put on it.\n\nWhich brings me to my next gripe - the waitress tried to tell me how it was prepared - but I couldn't hear a thing.  There were two separate music tracks going on - one downstairs, one up, and between that, the crowd and the speed that the waitress tried to explain (bless her) I didn't get any of it.  I tried to follow but couldn't and after twice trying to figure out how something was made gave up and decided to just enjoy.\n\nUp next - the tamales - which weren't tamales as I'd ever had them - more slices of a small loaf of corn bread with filling laced in.  They were good - but I preferred the Xochitl salad my GF went with.  Again - complex and tasty - but not really what I was looking for when I ordered tamales.\n\nNext the Tuna ceviches.  VERY tasty... and probably my favorite part of the meal.  A complex platter of savory and sweet.  My GF had the tostadas - which I think I might have preferred except that I wasn't a hige fan of the mackerel on that platter.\n\nFinally the main course.  Skirt steak was excellently prepared with a few different sauces and served with blue corn tortillas to wrap things up in.  As I wandered around the plate I enjoyed every bit of it separate - but as I began to combine things it had a sort of muttled effect.  At this point I think I was just tired of trying to distinguish so many ingredients in such complex plates.  I was also stuffed beyond imagination before the main course showed up.  I tasted my GFs black bass - the fish was AMAZING... but when I mixed another bite of the plantains and sauce I liked it less.  Again - I think both dishes woud have been AMAZING if I had had them in second course.\n\nFinally dessert was churros and chocolate (defined as churros with litle dishes of sauces) and a crowsie of my GFs caramelized bananna with walnut ice cream.  Both very delishious.  After the spice in the meal I needed the ice cream - and the two dishes together were fabulous.\n\nSo in the end - I am being fairly harsh on this place.  I'd say that every plate was great on it's own - it was teh combination where things broke down.  There were also issues where some of the fried foods tasted like they had been left out a while before service... but I guess I expect that maybe showing up late to a dinner service.  But in the end - it felt like a $30 a plate service I paid $60 a plate for... so it's going to get compared to places I would pay that much at... and it simply doesn't match up.\n\nI think if I went back I would go with two courses and dessert and show up at the beginning of service.  I recommend you do the same.  I may give that a try - and if I do I'll update the 'ol Yelp review.\n\nFINAL NOTE: It felt like I should have been dressed better than I was... but everyone else was dressed casually too.", "p": [], "n": []}, {"business_id": "ZYRul0i1bhOjirHED6Kd0w", "name": "SouthHouse", "date": "2015-03-05 21:44:33", "stars": 5.0, "text": "Solid bar in South Philly.

Good music and comfortable atmosphere made my wait pleasant. I was early, and Abbey was right on time taking me to get started. I came in with a photo as vague inspiration, but left the reality of the haircut totally up to Abbey. She looked and and played with my hair, asking relevant questions to make sure she had a full understanding of my hairtype before getting started. I also appreciate that she explained the products she was using during the wash (DevaCurl), what she was doing during the cut and why, and a quick way to style everyday before doing the blowout. I've never loved a blowout this much in my life-- they usually leave my hair flat on top and otherwise looking like a primped poodle-- but Abbey left me with surprisingly straight, frizz-free hair that's lasted to the next day. Loving everything about my hair so far; Abbey really knows what she's doing and she is an all around nice and comfortable person to interact with :) Bonus: the cut was totally affordable compared to other salons in Philadelphia and I feel like with the time and thought put into the experience, it was the best value I've seen so far!", "p": ["Hair Salons", "Beauty & Spas"], "n": []}]}

Since my first visit, the fries themselves have been scaled down in size. The portion is still the same, and they're still relatively thick cut, but the fries are no longer reminiscent of The Flintstones. I think this has has ultimately improved them, they seem crisper and less starchy. The cheese sauce is great, if you're in the mood for it, but, again, these fries don't need anything.\n\nThe burger has remained consistently amazing and perfectly cooked. This seriously might be my favorite burger in Philly. The fat to meat ratio is perfect, as is the bread to patty ratio. Yes, I consider these things. The bun was an obviously fresh brioche, topped with sesame, I need to figure out how to make these at home. But the dressing is what takes it from excellent to incredible- it is a type of thousand island with a hint of smokiness. Seriously, I wanted to order some to dip my perfect-on-their-own fries in. And it comes with a pickle, which also tasted a bit different, in a good way, from the last time I was here. The burger starts at $9 and the price goes up as you add toppings, so it ends up about what a gastropub would charge for an inferior product. Although, the cheddar seems a bit overpriced at $3.\n\nFor drinks, Chad stuck with Ommegang. They do have a good beer list here which had pretty much every major variety you could desire covered. I stuck with the mixed stuff, the Ginger Rogers was the highlight. Not too sweet, not too floral, not overwhelmingly gingery. It was perfectly balanced and far more potent than it tasted.

They have several tables but for me, the real action is sitting at the pizza counter and watching the line do its thing.\n\nIndividual bins with dates are stacked on the left indicating which day the dough was made.  The guys working the line pull out a dough ball and begin shaping it.  Next, the stretched dough gets one set of a myriad of toppings (fresh sauce, prosciutto, aged cheese, tuna (yes they have a tonno pie) and then is whisked away into that oven.\n\nSeven (7) or so minutes later, the pie gets kissed to the top of the oven and comes out piping hot with crispy bubbled edges.  Usually, the pies get a finishing of some sort (fresh herbs, some spice or a sprinkling of an aged cheese) before it's handed off to you.\n\nThe only rub of this place is getting a seat during popular times.

I pretty much never expect good coffee from a food establishment.  The coffee at Honey's is delicious and very abundant.  I think they learned to serve coffee from window salesman.  Seriously, they push that stuff.  I'm totally fine with that.\n\nI've only had one thing on the menu thus far.  It was the scrambled eggs with the nova lox and onions.  On our server's suggestion (and thankfully she did suggest it) adding goat cheese and avocado.  She also said something about the nutritional fact of the avocado and what health benefit it would give to me.  I never really thought avocados were a tough sell, but hey, it was funny.\n\nI opted for the potato latka and a muffin because from the second I sat down I wanted to try the jam sitting on the table.  It was great.  The latka, tasted like I had expected it to.  I read reviews of other yelpers and they all raved about it.  I guess I expected more.\n\nThe eggs were cooked perfectly and the salmon was very tasty, extremely smoky.  I like smoky things.  If something is advertised to be smoky and it's not, I get upset.  Honey's did not upset me.\n\nMy friend had the challah french toast and a side of bacon.  I love challah french toast but I never want a whole plate of it.  I had my forkful and I was satisfied.  I will try to convince other people to have it just so I can go back and get my one forkful.\n\nThank you Honey's.  You helped break down some of the philly hatred in my friend from nyc.

Garlic dipping sauce on the side and lighly battered and quickly fried.  Almost tempora style.  I got to taste the special burger (blue cheese, red wine reduction, arugula on ciabatta) and the special grilled cheese, I believe it was brie and figs.  I also tasted the mac and cheese which was made with shells and I don't think contained gruyere which I always thought was necessary in good mac and cheese.

It would've been nice if the server had noted that because Express Lunches are served all 3 courses together, they do not come out as prepared (they're held under a heating lamp till all pieces are ready) and therefore it might be faster for a large group to order off the regular menu.

Taste-wise, my medium-rare burger with goat cheese and egg is comparable to BBP or 500 Degrees. The meat and egg were prepared the way I like it, and the toppings were of high quality, especially the cheese. (Note that the egg yolk is runny! If you don't like that or are afraid of salmonella, let them know.) The only thing I did not like as much was how heavily the hamburger buns were buttered. That was just a little bit too much for my taste, but I know many people who would love the slightly sweet, buttery bun. However, the burger I got was 16 dollars (11 for the burger, 3.50 for the cheese and 1.50 for the egg), which is exactly the price of the burger at Craigie on Main. In case you don't frequent Boston as much, Craigie's is a 'real' gourmet burger where French fries and a small salad are included in the price. At VW, we had to order French fries for 5 dollars on the side, which were delicious and came with a well-spiced ketchup.\n\nI like the atmosphere of the place, and the location which made seating outside more pleasant than at BBP's right on Walnut Street. The service also was excellent (very much unlike BBP). The staff appears professional, they are attentive and fill up your water very regularly.\n\nAll in all, it's a 3.5 - the good burger, atmosphere and service warrant a high rating, but the extraordinarily high price (for what you get) is rather a downer, and I can't give 4 stars to a place where I am unsure whether I'd want to come back. I do like the concept of letting the customer choose their own toppings, which allowed me to choose a combination of toppings you never see but I personally enjoy. On the other hand, the menu of this place is largely uninspired and boring, which in turn is Bobby's Burger Palace's strongest point.

Perhaps this was due to my low expectations. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nI ordered a gaggle of tuxedos for my groomsmen at my wedding last month. The challenge in arranging the tuxedos was primarily due to the groomsmen living in all different area of the country. Men's Wearhouse seemed like the only plausible option to get everyone fitted with the same outfit.\n\nA couple of the groomsmen received jackets that were way off, size-wise. On one hand, I don't really understand how that can happen. They weren't measured incorrectly, there were simply typos when the customer service reps were entering the data into their computer. Whoopsie. How do you not double check that? I mean when you are in the special events industry you have an enhanced duty to not mess up. That's because at the very least you're ruining someone's prom, or you might be screwing up someone's wedding. That's a big responsibility and as a company, it and its employees should take that responsibility seriously. \n\nFortunately for my crew, the ones who had major errors on their outfits were able to get proper fitting outfits. Luck would have it this only happened to the two groomsmen who didn't have to get on a plane to make it to the wedding. Lucky indeed because the ones flying in wouldn't have the time to have it fixed. They wouldn't have the time because of Men's Wearhouse scheme to charge you more than necessary. See if you are flying in from out of town for a wedding as a groomsman, you can either pick up your Tuxedo before you get on the plane or after you arrive at your destination, because MW usually has it ready for pick up 2-3 days before your event. So you can pick it up before you get on the plane, but only if they don't mess up. If they do mess up, then you have to get on the plane without the Tuxedo. Now, the other option is to pick up the Tuxedo at your destination. The problem with that is if you're coming from out of town for a wedding, you're likely only getting there a day before you need it, so if they mess up, there's no time for them to fix it. It's just a messed up system. If you're all local, I guess it's OK, but then you might as well go somewhere that has better selection, prices, more knowledgeable staff, better service and more reasonable policies.\n\nAside from that whole issue, the rest of the experience was fine. The customer service is atrocious. Each time I went to this location (except the last when I met with the nice large bearded Ginger man (red-headed) who was nice), I had a different bad type of customer service. I had my most annoying experience, the \"I'm doing you a favor by taking your money\" type, the \"I have no idea how to use the computer system here and am too proud to ask for help\" type, the \"i am way too creative for this corporate job and norms of society but i still work here because i need a job\" type. It seems like everyone (except big Ginger) hates working here and that doesn't really improve the customer experience.\n\nThe other frustrating experiences centered around the staff's (at best) incompetence. How many times did I have to confirm with them that everyone came in for their fitting, that each tuxedo was being shipped to the proper location? I paid in full for all the groomsmen's tuxes, and they still tried to hit each one of them up for money. Only after the groomsmen told them they shouldn't have to pay did the customer service reps \"realize\" that. \n\nOn the bright side, everything ended up being fine. The replacement tuxedos arrived on time, and everyone looked OK. I didn't want cummerbunds, but I wanted shirts that have studs all the way down to the waist. So when I put the order in, I said give me the shirts with holes for studs all the way down to the waist, and give me cummerbunds if you don't have shirts like that. Well, I got no cummerbunds with the wrong shirts.\n\nThey give you a free cheap suit made by the MW brand that's worth $150 that they try to sell for $550 when you get 6 or more tuxedo rentals. You can also get a free tuxedo rental in place of the free cheap suit.

The lamb was dry, definitely go with the beef kebabs. The couscous was ok, not really great but it probably would have been better to give that before the meat courses because we were getting stuffed.

Pizzera Vetri far exceeded my expectations in these categories. We arrived here a little unconventially, which was a result of my boyfriend asking an ESPN baseball writer and self-proclaimed \"food lover\" (better than 'foodie') about his favorite places to eat in Philly via Twitter, so this was an intentional trip with high hopes!\n\nAfter crusing around the Fairmount area for a while, I was surprised to walk into a high-ceilinged room with a primarily industrial feel. It was empty but we were greeted by a friendly host who directed us to one of the enormous community size tables. Our server was very helpful in explaining the menu for us first-timers and gave off a very positive and approachable vibe. She recommended getting two pizzas between the two of us because she \"usually just eats one for herself.\" While I didn't forsee that happening, there were so many appealing choices, I couldn't rule anything out! \n\nWe started with that and the arugula salad, which is made with coal roasted potatoes, pesto and taggiasca olives. I could tell by looking at the salad that it would be good; and every single bite was leafy green heaven. The pesto was perfect, light on the oil and a great complement to the other ingredients. I actually found that the heavy potatoes detracted from the enjoyment of the salad and left those to the side.  \n\nThe first pizza that grabbed my attention was the Renato, a simple white pizza with mozzarella, rosemary, olive oil and sea salt. I was somewhat underwhelmed with my first few bites, but later realized that piece was just burnt! (Hey, it's thin crust pizza, have to take the good with the bad.) My un-burnt slice was the PERFECT white pizza, which is one that hold its own and doesn't make you think \"wait, something is missing here!\" Pizza can be just as perfect without all that red sauce. But, speaking of which...\n\nWe quickly came to a mutual agreement that a second pizza was necessary to sate both our palates and our curiosity. Our server recommened the marinara pizza with oregano, crushed san marzano tomatoes, garlic and olive oil. We added mozzarella because cheese is one thing a pizza should NOT be without! This pizza was also perfection, quite an upgrade from what you'll find at your local shopping plaza pizza joint. It's obvious that they use fresh and quality ingredients which is always a plus. My only qualm was that the pizzas are a little small for what they cost, but I suppose that ties in with the quality appeal. We ended up not being able to finish everything and took several slices home, so these babies still lasted a while. (Though I cannot confirm nor deny if I took a bite of leftover Renato on the way home.)\n\nBelieve it or not, after all the cheese was said and the olive oil was done, we still ordered dessert. We definitely chose the worst dessert on the menu; not my first choice, not pointing any fingers though... We shared the fried pizza dough with citrus fennel sugar. It had way too much fennel that didn't do much being just slapped on top of fiery spheres of tasteless, deep-fried carbs. Not the best way to end our meal, but now we know for next time.\n\nOverall, fantastic pizza and minimalistic yet comfortable atmosphere. I can't wait to go back and try some more of the specialty pizzas.

So many folks just don't get it right. The meat's overworked, the patty to bun ratio is off-kilter, the toppings feel like an afterthought. But, on those rare occasions that I hear from multiple individuals (friends, family, and strangers alike) that Village Whiskey offers \"The best burger of their lives\".... well, when in Rome.

Really, juicy is the word that comes to mind for this entire meal. It's the kind of meal that makes you wish your napkin came with two other napkins, the kind of juicy that results in finger-licking and bun-dipping. Unfortunately, unlike some reviewers, my egg wasn't particularly runny, but I'm sure that could be resolved with a simple request, and honestly....

And what makes it even better is it's BYOB! My family and I were coming into town yesterday and decided to give this place a try because it came highly recommended by several friends. I am SO glad we did!!! Ill break down my review into sections. \n\nFIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT, THE FOOD!!! I wish yelp had smell-o-gram so you all could smell the left over pork chop siciliana i just devoured (way too big for me to finish at dinner. So stuffed!) \n\nTo start, myself and my family ordered some of the signature appetizers that came recommended by our server. We order the stuffed artichoke and figs and sausage. The stuffed artichoke was great, but let me tell you.. The figs and sausage left me speechless. SERIOUSLY. I would have licked the plate if I could. It's was that good! It really is a must try. Take my word for it!\n\nFor salad we split the grilled romaine with a sweet balsamic dressing topped with strawberrys and Gorgonzola. Where do they come up with this stuff! Literally one of the best salads (and everyone at the table would agree) that I've ever had! \n\nFor dinner, yes.. I had the pork chop siciliana. To die for! As noted before, my chop was HUGE and i couldn't finish it. So tender and packed with flavor! And now my dog is chewing the bone :-P\n\nI am so grateful I got to go here with three of my family members because my fork would not stay in my own dish. I sampled my mothers gnocchi Gorgonzola. It's was so creamy and delightful. Little pillows of heaven as my mother said.  And my father had the steak big John. Also super tender and packed with flavor. My uncle had the special whole bronzino that came recommended yet again by our server. Boy the don't disappoint! \n\nSERVICE: was amazing! Our server (a man with dark hair.. Think his name was Marc)  went above and beyond to make our dining experience memorable. Super attentive. We told him we were out-of-towner's and he really went above his means to accommodate us. Our bread basket was never empty nor was our wine glasses. The hostess was very pleasant and always smiling. Also, One of the owners/chef Michael stopped by our table to see how we liked everything. What a nice (and unheard of) gesture! The restaurant was a little full at the time and the fact that the chef took the time out really says a lot! The care these people took in making sure we enjoyed our experience was just so great and made our experience that much more enjoyable. \n\nAMBIANCE: was lovely. The lighting is fairly dim and Sinatra was playing in the back ground. It's a little small family owned Byob in the heart of south Philly. What more could you ask for!\n\n5 stars does not do this restaurant justice. If your looking for true delicious authentic Italian food, huge portions made by true authentic Italian people, then this is your place! Ps. You better come with an appetite that's for sure!\n\nIndebted forever to my friends who recommended this place.

I was disappointed that I was never told what a great hospital this was for emergency cases.\n\nWe were seen by a nurse within 2 seconds of our arrival. We did not call ahead. He was taken back right away and a nurse took information about what happened. We waited about five minutes then were asked if its ok to give him pain medication through a catheter. Of course we said it was ok. About 10 minutes after that they asked us to come to the back again for another report of what happened. We explained again and they were very interested in the scissors that were used in case there was bacteria or rust they should be worried about. We explained the scissors and were told exactly what they were going to do to our little Sammy. We were told it would take 2 hours to clean him up so we were able to go home and come back. \n\n3 stitches, $420 bucks (no pet insurance) and 2 1/2 hours later, Sammy was back at home completely shaved, nails cut and surprisingly full of energy. The stitches will have to be removed in 10-14 days but according to the doc, this will be free of charge. We also have the option of removing them at our regular Vet's office. \n\nThe hospital was very impressive. You'd think it was a hospital for people. The staff was quick but thorough and very nice.

The \"Crudo\" had prosciutto, mozzarella, parmesan cheese and the \"Melanzana\" had crushed san marzano tomatoes, eggplant, stracciatella cheese, and oregano. The Melanzana was my absolute favorite and I could eat two of those pies myself. The pizza is thin crust and comes out extremely hot. For those people who complain about the crust being burnt, it's an extremely hot oven! You may have to sacrifice a few burnt pieces for pure perfection!

I was thinking about veal since I knew that Italians really do make it best.  My husband and I stopped in to make a reservation for later that night and the host was very friendly and said \"We don't have anything open until 8:30pm\" but that was no problem for us and we just strolled around the surrounding area and stopped in a few shops while we were waiting.  At 8:15 we came back and our table was ready.  We sat down and were promptly served a nice cool glass of ice water.  My husband ordered an Italian Kiss which is some sort of espresso mixed drink.  He said it was out of this world.  A few minutes later we were served some delicious Italian bread and butter.  The bread was wonderful.  We then placed our order after looking over the menu.   We got the escargot as our appetizer.  This was absolutely wonderful!   My husband knew he wanted the Seafood Pescatore.  I decided to have the Veal Marsala and a side of meatballs.  We enjoyed our bread until our meals were brought out.  Now my Veal Marsala was hands down the best dinner out I have EVER had.  The veal was tender, the mushrooms were delicious, and the sauce,  well I think I had dreams about it that night.  My husband's dinner was also wonderful.  He used to prepare this himself and was surprised at how fresh and tender the mussels were .  He said he would get that again.  Now the meatballs are something you HAVE to get if you go to Ralph's!!!  These were nice and firm and the gravy was wonderful!  After all this good food we had to finish off the night with a cannoli.  My husband and I both ordered one and got one to go for my Dad.  Well those were crisp and the filling was the best i've ever had!    We will be returning to try more of their food.  Thank you Ralph's for making my 30th birthday incredible!", "p": ["Restaurants", "Italian"], "n": []}]}

First of all, it's impossible to discount the location. If you're visiting Philadelphia and are looking to explore some of the sites in the old city this is definitely the place to go. We stayed over the July 4th weekend and were right in the middle of all the festivities. The room is beautiful and colorful and fun and well furnished. The front desk staff and  front door personnel are always very helpful. The room is plenty spacious with great views, at least from our room. Make sure to sign up for the reward program as you'll have free wifi and a ten dollar credit for either the mini bar or the bar downstairs. The hotel is also pet friendly which is a great option for those traveling with pets. A few issues that did arise during our stay. The bed is very firm, so be aware of that if you have issues with that type of bed. Also, parking is by valet only and costs $50 which is quite steep. If you don't mind the walk, there is a parking garage, Bourse, about a block and a half away which only charges $28. There are also no garbage bags in the room which can be quite annoying when you're traveling with pets. There was also a dog on my floor which kept barking for about five hours straight numerous nights in a row. The hotel staff did not seem to be able to handle this situation, except to call my room asking me to control and handle my dogs which were silent. Finally, there was a fire alarm that went off which forced us to evacuate from the tenth floor with the dogs which wasn't much fun using the stairs. If possible, even though the view won't be as great if traveling with pets try to get a lower room just in case.", "p": ["Hotels & Travel", "Hotels"], "n": ["Hotels & Travel", "Hotels"]}]}

I have received so many compliments on the color and even the cut he gave (I'm not very willing to cut my long hair so he shaped it perfectly)!\n\nI will definitely be back for haircut, toning, and after care!\n\n I was shocked by the great price as well!

I was shocked because every other time I had been there the place was packed and there was a wait. I was excited that we could be seated so soon and figured it was a fluke, but after the meal I think the slow night was probably because other people have noticed the evident decline. \n\nI will say the Caesar salad that I ordered was sublime. The romaine was crisp and fresh and the dressing was delicious. Garlicky and creamy and honestly one of the best renditions of the classic salad I have had in the city. \n\nWe also went with the ricotta and flat bread starter. Yuck! Gross! Blarg! (It was so gross it deserves the invention of a new word to explain how I feel about it.) The ricotta was grainy and gloopy. Maybe I am spoiled bc I live on 13th with easy access to the heavenly ricotta available at Zavino and Barbuzzo. This is a travesty to the cheese world. I don't even know how they made it so badly, but it was. \n\nWe went with the sausage pizza, ordered well done. When it came out I had high hopes seeing the bubbly black charred bits on the crust, but one bite in I realized it was false advertising. I can only guess that the temperature of wood fire oven was WAY off...the dough cooked too quickly on the outside giving the appearance of a well cooked pizza, but in reality the interior was still chewy and doughy--not even close to done!  \n\nThe other big offense was the greasiness of the pie. At first I thought it was just very fatty (albeit flavorful sausage) but I started watching the chef actually making the pizzas (we were sitting at the bar overlooking the oven.)  When every single pizza came out of the oven he proceeded to pour more olive oil on it...why?! It isn't adding flavor to the pizza, just additional fat and moisture. Maybe on a crispy pizza it wouldn't have been so offensive but on my barely cooked dough it was a mess. \n\nWe also ordered a carafe of sangria to split. While the flavor was a little too sweet for me, it was drinkable. My only question is why are they serving apple/cinnamon sangria in the Spring? Shouldn't sangria have a seasonal fresh profile...very confusing drinking this on a warm April night. \n\nI am sad to say I probably will not be back to Stella after last night.

After my last post, the manager invited me back to try them out, and suggested I did so during happy hour, since that's when they had the best deals. Unfortunately, who actually is out of work by 6? (The answer is actually me...but not my husband, and there was no way I was braving this \"bro bar\" alone.\") \n\nUnfortunately, my expectations were sorely not met although I still really think that this place has a TON of potential, and I just don't think I am their target audience. \n\nThe service: Whoa guys...calm down. You do not need to watch me eat my entire meal and stop by no less than SIX times to ask if everything is okay. Between the hostess, the waitress and the manager, it was like we were being stalked. I get it, they want good tips, they want good reviews. But no one likes the clingy girl at the dance. Try to play a little hard to get. \n\nAs a side note here, I was really taken aback by the servers outfits. I didn't realize that this was Hooters meet German pub. I think there is a slightly more classy way to slutty German barmaid (look at Brahaus on South St. for example.) However, the black booty shorts with suspenders and t shirt really aren't doing it for me.  Honestly, from the front, the apron is longer than the shorts, so it literally looks like they aren't wearing anything on bottom.  Listen, I am all for \"if ya got it flaunt it\" but I don't think it's fitting in a setting like this that is trying to appeal to the masses. Maybe the management isn't aware they should be appealing to a wider clientele than the Jersey Shore? \n\nThe food: If you are going to have such a limited menu, everything on it has to be SPOT on. Once again, this just seemed like the chef is trying too hard. For example: potato pancakes are good. Green apples are good. Horseradish is good. However, when you put them all together, it a muddled mess for your palette.  The schnitzel I had was WAY overfried and had no flavor. They put ham on it too...who puts ham on schnitzel? Overkill. The bread on my sandwich and on my hub's bratwurst sandwich was also really dry and stale. Also the sign out front that says \"The best wurst in the city.\" It's not true. It's so not true. My husband didn't even finish half of his sandwich! This is a man I have seen eat (and enjoy) peanut butter, grape jelly and sausage sandwiches. The fact that he didn't enjoy his meal says more to me than anything.\n\nOverall: This place is probably appealing to a different demographic than the crowd I usually run with.

I ordered a Smuttynose Robust Porter, Crawfish Hush Puppies, and the Village Burger, medium rare. \n\nThe beer wasn't bad, although I'm not a fan of dark beers, it wasn't too bitter and had an okay taste. Not much else to say, except I wish they had more wheat beers available. But it's a Whiskey Bar, so I can't really blame them for lack of beer variety.\n\nThe Crawfish Hush Puppies were next- they looked like crabcakes in the shape of  fish sticks. They came with a green sauce on the side, which was fantastic, but the Hush Puppies on their own seemed a bit bland and unseasoned. I wish I had asked for more of the sauce, but I wanted to see if the Hush Puppies could stand on their own, which they couldn't.\n\nThe Village Burger, which this place is apparently famous for, came next. To preface this part of the review, I had high expectations after having heard that it was one of the best burgers in all of Philadelphia. If this is the best burger Philadelphia has to offer, I'd rather go to Shake Shack across the street. Basically, it tasted like a regular burger to me. There was a nice sauce on the buns, the burger was cooked nicely, but it wasn't seasoned well and overall was quite disappointing. It could be because I didn't get any extra toppings on it, but a burger should at least be seasoned and have a flavor of its own... I did not taste anything special.\n\nThe service was acceptable- the bartender was alert and ready to help, but the servers brought food to the wrong people... twice. \n\nOverall, the beer was a 3, the burger was a 2, the hush puppies were a 3.5, and the service was a 3.5. I'd like to try more of their appetizers (which reminds me, they ran out of deviled eggs! How do you run out of deviled eggs before 2pm on a Saturday?!) and alcohol in the future, but I'm not desperate to go back any time soon.", "p": [], "n": ["Bars", "Burgers", "Restaurants"]}]}

So, we kept on. \n\nThen we passed Lloyd and decided to give it a try. My girlfriend loves whiskey,  the menu looked interesting, and it was busy, but not filled to the gills. So, in we went. \nMy immediate reaction to the decor/ambiance was that it felt like an upscale VFW. The bar is adorned with mismatched stuffed armchairs (cozy!) and fun vintage wall art that has a cabin in the woods and/or dark pool hall feel. There was something just a little off on the overall vibe. I got the sense that the owners had a limited budget to dedicate towards the design and decor. Maybe it was the startlingly white acoustical grid ceiling, or the Pergo floors that make that dreadful hollow knocking sounds when you walk across them, or maybe it was the off-the-shelf white folding residential closet door covering what I assume was a storage closet. This sounds overly nit-picky, but when I think \"whiskey bar\" I imagine a dark, dimly lit, cozy space with dark (real) wood accents and leather. Also, it lacked a good seating area adjacent to the bar. A overly wide space between the tables and bar felt like an unused dance floor. \n\nBut enough about the design of the space. Now to the important part. The food.\n\nI got suckered into some special cocktail that was made with a whiskey that aged for 6 months in some special aged oak barrel. It was yummy, but at $13 a pop - I didn't go for another round. For food bits we got roasted beets in a siracha honey glaze, chicken liver mousse pate with bread, and a mozzarella & prosciutto with broccoli rabe sandwich. I loved the beets and the chicken liver. The sandwich was  good, but basic. There wasn't a crumb left on any of the plates and the servings were pretty generous.  The two cocktails my ladyfriend had were also super yummy, and a much more reasonable $9 a piece.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my experience. The service was very good, the food hit the spot. I would go back again to try their other offerings. I only dwell so long on the ambiance of the place because I think they have a good thing going, but in a town like Philly where there are so many good restaurants with great atmosphere and design, a restaurant has to do more than make good food to survive long term. I hope this place continues to do well. It's great having another quality place to go to in Fishtown.", "p": ["Restaurants", "Cocktail Bars", "Bars", "American (New)"], "n": ["Nightlife"]}, {"business_id": "QWqKTWQ2OiDgo3dzNkpung", "name": "Jong Ka Jib", "date": "2013-02-04 16:35:24", "stars": 5.0, "text": "This is my new favorite spot.

I came here about a year & a half ago after they had newly opened up. I had heard about 'floating' about 10 years prior & had always wanted to try it. When I heard Halcyon Floats was opening up, this was the only place locally I could find offering floats, so I started stalking their social media accounts to be one of the first to go. I treated myself to a float for my birthday, and went on a weekend morning.\n\nWhen I arrived I was kindly greeted by the owner, a young woman who was happy & eager to have me frequenting her new business. I waited on a chair in the front of the storefront for the people currently in the tank rooms to finish up. When they came out, the owner told me it would just be a few min as she needed to clean the tanks (something done between every use). At this time she started explaining the process & what to do while in there.\n\nOnce in the room containing the tank I undressed & took all clothing/jewelry off. I was instructed to shower off first before entering the tank to help preserve the sanitation of the tank, so I did. I then put my ear plugs in, grabbed the floating light provided & hopped in. Almost immediate upon touching the water, my hands started stinging... I forgot to use the Vaseline provided on any small cuts on my body (for me I had to put it on my cuticles). I quickly hopped out, applied the Vaseline & back into the tank I went. Much better now. \n\nI laid back in the warm water getting settled in. Started with the light on, but then turned it off. And then I waited, and waited. I waited for something to happen. I had heard stories of seeing & smelling things by people during their floating experience. I had none. I tried everything in me to fall asleep or get into a meditative state, but I was bored out of my mind the whole time and was just waiting for the time to pass so I could get out. I could hear some of the sounds from the street, even with ear plugs in, which may have prevented me from fully 'zoning out'. I just remember getting out of the tank and wishing I had spent that time & money on a massage instead. \n\nAfter leaving the tank, I got dressed again & exited the room. The owner greeted me & offered me a chair in the back area with beverages. I made myself a hot cup of tea & chatted with the guy who was in the other tank floating at the same time as me. (He found his float to be very relaxing & had fallen asleep).\n\nI'm disappointed that I didn't have a relaxing float as all the others on here have reported. I suppose floating just isn't for me. One part of me wants to give it another shot & try another float, but again, I would rather put that money towards a massage which I know will be relaxing. But please, don't let my review stop you from trying it out if you're curious to try floating. This is just my experience, and from the other reviews I seem to be in the minority.\n\nI wish this business the best of luck, and hope that for whoever would benefit from floating tries it out!", "p": [], "n": ["Float Spa"]}, {"business_id": "rQW9iupvhk6ScPn2VPNLVQ", "name": "Octopus Falafel Truck", "date": "2014-07-08 21:51:43", "stars": 2.0, "text": "Recently stumbled across this food truck while walking to Trader Joes.

Creamy, cheesy, gooey and the toppings are always plentiful.

Which, ok, if this is standard mac & cheese reheating techniques, who am I to judge. But it doesn't look like they heat up enough mac & cheese at a time to keep up with the long line & demand, which would explain serving barely warm bowls as they just try to get it out. My thought would be a few more of these reheating stations (they only had one that I saw) & maybe one more employee would help prevent lukewarm mac & cheese from being served, and might also help speed up the line a bit.\n\nThese kinks won't stop me from visiting the only mac & cheese shop in Philly, but it has made me frequent it far less often.", "p": [], "n": ["Restaurants"]}]}

The goat was in two forms in the dish, ground in the chili itself and slow cooked pulled placed delicately on top of the cornbread crowning the dish. The corn bread was a little too sweet for my tastes but I understand that it was meant to contrast the salinity of the chili. On to the desserts and drinks. I enjoyed the apple fritters. The reminded me of homemade doughnuts from my childhood all covered in cinnamon and sugar. I ordered the \"Colonial\" which is rye whiskey and the Root Snap with apply cider.

Also may the hands of whoever is controlling the music and its volume fall off. Way too loud. If your servers have to yell at the guests just to ask if they want a drink then the music is too loud.

But the place was not packed so I see little excuses for the kitchen to be so abhorrently slow. Service was average with the exception of the busing staff. They were prompt, friendly, and efficient. I hope the servers tip out to them. \n\nNow lets get to the awfulness that is the food. If you are vegetarian or even occasionally enjoy a veggie dish or two like me, do not come here. I was enticed in by descriptions of dishes like Azteca civeche \"Pickled late-summer vegetables served on warm sopes with salsa verde\". Sounds tasty right? Wrong, it was a sloppy mess of veggies which ranged from pure vinegar to raw. The taste was nothing but sour and overly spicy. None of the veggies retained their own flavors. Moving on to the next course was only slightly better. The pumpkin & black bean empanadas were good but the black bean and the salsa negra overpowered the pumpkin. The final savory dish was terrible. The calabacitas description as follows sounds good \"Summer squash with their blossoms, vegetarian mole verde, swiss chard, pickled fennel\" but what I received was once again a sloppy mess of homogeneous textures, colors, and flavors that made me gag. This was served on a flavorless blue corn tortilla. This kind of food makes me weep for vegetarians who this chef ,obviously neither understand nor likes. Why would you serve something like this? I would be ashamed to let this out of my kitchen. Vegetarians do like flavor. At least a little salt or something. \n\nThe desserts were all average and felt like I could duplicated by getting a mix from my famous aunt Betty. The flan being the only exception, it was actually very nice. \n\nIn summary, we left discussing whether or not to stop by McD's to get some descent food on the way home.

I'm not sure how they make their tea, but it was really really strong rose flavor--very unpleasant because it didn't taste natural. It tasted like potpourri. I had to add water to make it enjoyable. Rose tea should have a nice smooth rose flavor!!! \n\nSoup dumplings. I normally don't order this and restaurants that don't specialize in it. The crab and pork ones were cheap so I tried it out. These were ok. Good amount of crab compared to other places. The soup wasn't too flavorful and the dumpling skin was somewhat thick. \n\nI ordered a noodle with pork sauce. Sometimes this dish gets bad translations so you might get something different than expected... This was one of the times. I thought it would be Zha Jiang Mian, but I think they served me Dan Dan noodles. It had a strong sesame seed/peanut taste so that's why I think it was Dan Dan noodles. Portion was good, but if this was considered Dan Dan noodles, it lacked flavor. \n\nOrdered a fried chicken with chili. I forget the name. This was pretty good. I would order this again. \n \nFood took awhile which was fine bc it was soft opening. The soup dumplings I figure would take the longest but that came out first. The noodles took a long time to come out, so that's why I think they served me Dan Dan noodles and not Zha Jiang Mian. However, if I'm wrong, please let me know! \n\nOn food and service, I would rate it 3 stars. It was just ok. Im talking away 1 star for something that shouldn't have happened. \n\nThe restaurant had about 6 tables full. A server was moving plates/napkin/chopsticks to make room for another table.

Sure, if the move goes smoothly, there's nothing to worry about and both parties are happy, but in my case, my couch was damaged during the move and It Can Fit said they would try to fix the couch. This is where they really failed to deliver.\n\nThey said they would come the next day after the move; no show. I gave them a full business week to respond, but there was no followup. After calling and reminding them and saying I wasn't going to write a negative review without first giving them a chance to make things right, they set up an appointment. At the time of the appointment, I get a call saying they're not going to be able to make it. Rescheduled to a different day and same story; I get a call half an hour before the appointment. The third time's the charm right?! But this time, there's not even a call - just a complete no-show after I had asked them if they were certain that they could make it this third time.\n\nAnyway, I'm left with my broken couch. No followup from these guys. Sure, they are priced slightly lower to other big-name movers, but I would recommend paying the difference and going for a more professional company if the items you are moving are expensive.\n\nAnother thing to note was they were 3 hours late for the move. At least that time they called and let me know.\n\nI completely sympathize if the guys were tired after multiple moves in the day, but nobody's doing anyone any favors here.

I can say that there were 0 disappointments the entire night! We received exceptional service and excellent food! We ordered the Simple Green Salad (far from simple, DELICIOUS LIGHT DRESSING), The Prince Edward Island Mussels (PERFECTLY cooked- all mussels opened and not chewy at all!), The Grilled Lamb Loin, and Seared Red Snapper Veracruz Style- BOTH so unique and flavorful! For Dessert we had the bread pudding (best I have ever had in my life!)  The waiter was extremely personable and the manager came over multiple times to ensure that we were having a great experience. I have respect for this establishment- there are two types of people in this world, people who work for the paycheck and people who work because they love and care about what they do. This staff works for their wonderful reputation.You can tell that the Red Owl Tavern's employees try to establish a relationships with their guests, rather than just trying to flip tables and want to be hospitable. The manager was in communication with us the entire night, ensuring we were having a great experience, as well as the waiter being prompt and attentive from the moment we sat down to when we left.

Don't eat too much food from the salad bar/appetizer dishes/bread basket cause it'll fill you up before you even get to the steaks/meats! Eat all the meat you can fit in your tummy because they are amazing in flavor. My favorite meat has to be filet mignon omg.

The cucumbers and bell peppers and carrots and cucumber were good, but the eggplant stole the show. \n\nCourse 2: The B'stella- As someone who doesn't normally love sweets but loves cinnamon, carbs and meat, this dish was a winner. This dish was dough filled with chicken, nuts, almonds, egg, peppers and onions. It was really hot at first, but once you cracked open the shell and let it cool down, it was easier to eat. I had some pita saved from the first course, so I found it easy to break off a piece and rest it on the pita while it cooled down. Truly a sweet-savory delight. \n\nCourse 3: Chicken- So here's where the choices began. You can either get chicken with lemon or spicy chicken. My group opted to get the spicy chicken with the cumin sauce on the side. The chicken was melt in your hands and then melt in your mouth good. The spicy sauce had a nice kick without being overly spicy to me. I still had some pita leftover so I did a little dipping with the sauce. \n\nCourse 4: Beef or Lamb- My table got a little creative here and asked for half portions of both the beef and lamb. The beef was served shish kebab style, and to be honest, not my favorite. It was a little well done, and I struggled a little to get it off the stick resulting in a pepper flying into my husband's wine glass. Sauvignon blanc tastes best with a little pepper anyways, right? The lamb was perfect. Even the non-lamb eaters thought it was delicious. It was tender and took on the flavor of the chick peas and onions without having an overwhelming lamb flavor. \n\nCourse 5: Couscous with veggies, chick peas and raisins- This was probably my least favorite dish from the main meal. It was a little blander than other couscous dishes I've tried in the past. I would have been disappointed if this was the only thing I ordered, but everything was a hit thus far in the evening. They did give us spoons at this point, so don't worry about eating the little grains with your hands.\n\nCourses 6 & 7: Dessert- I'm assuming the tea, fruit and pastries count as the sixth and seventh courses. At this point in the evening, my bottle of wine had been consumed and I wasn't counting the dishes, and am making this assumption while referencing the menu. I'm not a tea fan so I passed. The pastries were little crisp triangles that reminded me of baklava. The fruit came out frozen was a little hard to eat. I nibbled on a strawberry and took a banana for the road since the majority of the group passed on the fruit. Perhaps the fruit was customary, but I thought a little unnecessary. If it's part of the traditional meal then no harm, no foul.  \n\nTo sum it up, I had delicious food and hours of fun. It's an experience not to be missed in Philadelphia, especially if you go with an adventurous group of friends.

It's the same delicious food, just in my pajamas in front of my TV. \n\nHaving experienced a day that could only be fixed by delivery, my husband handled all of the order details. I believe he placed directly with them, as we were able to pay in cash when the delivery guy arrived. The wait time was standard- I don't recall it arriving early nor do I recall being antsy about its whereabouts. \n\nI'm no stranger to the Imam Baldi. I think every time I have this eggplant in red sauce soufflé, I go on the record that this dish can turn me into a vegetarian. It came with the standard sides of rice, veggies and potatoes, all separated by little dividers as to not mingle. \n\nWe were first timers to the Skordalia.

Unfortunately, that is not the case, and since my initial review and I've only been back twice. \n\nMy first trip back was for my birthday and it was at least 6 months after my initial visit. I hyped the crap out of the place to my husband and probably set the bar way too high in my own head. As a result, I was a little disappointed. I had the Rotolo which was extraordinary but for whatever reason my Melanzana pizza fell a little flat to me personally. I ended up liking my husband's Salsiccia a little more.\n\nThis past Saturday night, my husband and I were looking for a causal but tasty date night so we decided to head back to Pizzeria Vetri. I took the restaurant off its pedestal and ended up having an exceptional dinner. Funny how that works, right? \n\nSo of course we had to get the Rotolo. I can see why it won a 2014 Best of Philly award. It was light, doughy and pesto perfection. I would still enjoy it without the mortadella and ricotta but that adds an even more flavor. I could probably be a happy camper with a meal of 3-4 Rotolos.\n\nI enjoyed the Salsiccia last time so decided to go for a repeat. It didn't disappoint. Pizzeria Vetri's Instagram page had also tantalized me with pictures of the special pizza of the day, so we had to give it a shot as well. It consisted of broccoli rabe stuffed porchetta, mozzarella, black pepper and pecorino cheese. The ingredients were basic enough for a gourmet pizza but together made for a really great taste. The combination of flavors was a little sharp but in a good way.\n\nThe service has been excellent for each of my three visits. Our servers have always been polite, professional and extremely polished. On our most recent visit the manager stopped by towards the end of our meal to see how we were doing. \n\nI don't love the communal style set-up. While dining out, I prefer the company of my own party. My husband and I have taken to liking to the counter seats that face the open kitchen. I personally found the pizza preparation to be extremely enjoyable to watch and for whatever reason oddly therapeutic and relaxing. \n\nMoral of my update: Pizzeria Vetri serves up some fabulous gourmet pizza but it isn't the best gourmet pizza in the world and certainly not the best atmosphere.

Well, apparently by the size of the crowd I'm not the only one that thinks this. I mean Night Market is fun if you like waiting in long lines with swarms of people. \n\nI didn't have much time to dedicate to South Street Night Market. My group probably got to South Street around 7:30 and had to leave for another event by 9/9:30. Rather than waiting in a beer line, we beelined to the state store. What a saving grace! We were able to buy \"juice boxes\" of wine and no one cared that we were drinking them in public on the street. \n\nEarlier in the day, I had printed out the map and vendor list and checked off about 20-25 places I would like to try. I had hoped to hit at least 2-3 places. Wishful thinking! I know I was being picky about my selections and expectations... I wanted to try a vendor that I've never had before and I didn't want to pick a restaurant that had a store front that I can visit any old day. We started at 9th and by the time we got to the corner of 6th, I knew I had to make a quick decision if I wanted to eat before leaving. Ka'Chi was in the right place at the right time. Luckily it was on my preselected list of vendors.\n\nI spent the majority of my time at Night Market waiting in that line. I was surrounded by friends and the other people on line were friendly so it could have been worse...it also could have been better. I'll review Ka'Chi separately but in short the food was good and I'm glad I waited BUT it really wasn't worth the wait.  Philadelphia has really stepped up its game with food trucks so its probably best to find them on an \"off\" day.

I ran from Franklin Square to Camden and back to Philly. I know people having been using the bridge for runs for years but I had NO idea how steep that was or what a great workout you can get. The pedestrian path is much steeper than the vehicle lanes. The pedestrian path is located on the east side of the bridge and is wide enough for runners, walkers and bikers to get a workout in. The same goes for the views when on the pedestrian path, except you get even more time to soak in the Philly skyline. \n\nBy nature of any bridge, traffic will suck.

Thankfully, neither scenario happened, and I was privileged to finally dine there last night. \n\nWith that being said, I obviously preemptively put Vetri Cucina on a pedestal surrounded with unrealistic hype. I had butterflies the moments leading up to my visit of combined sheer giddiness and nerves, that I would somehow be let done. I'm ecstatic to report that my dining experience at Vetri was one of the top dining experiences of my lifetime, and I found it to be truly everything everyone says it is, and more. \n\nUpon entry to the restaurant, I was actually a little uncertain. The hallway was narrow, and I had to walk through a crowd to get to the hostess stand. That literally was the lowlight of the evening, and that's not even horrible. Every aspect of the evening was stellar from there-on-out. \n\nWhere to begin? Well, to start, I wish I was taking notes. Our server was so knowledgeable that I wish I could've written down everything he said about the food and the wine. The wine paring was extraordinary from the thorough to description to the actual pairing. I had the six-pour pairing and I'd absolutely recommend going that route. I didn't view the actual list until after the meal, I didn't realize that they literally listed the wines and dishes they paired with on the page. This is a great keepsake, and guide for my own future pairings. \n\nAfter our aperol spritz, we started with a few \"snacks\" and a vegetable crudités platter for the table. We passed the veggies and helped ourselves to the snacks from the center of the table. Our next course, after the bread, was our antipasti. I didn't realize the plate in front of me was my tuna crudo, and mine alone. Theoretically, a group could share and pass everything. We did, to some extent, however we mostly ate the plate in front of us. Based on specific wine pairings, this does make sense.  \n\nTaking a step back, before our tasting journey began, our server gave us some time to discuss the menu and our preferences. I was told to \"not be shy\" if there was something I really wanted to try. While the tasting menu had the element of surprise at every course, the meal was centered around that initial conversation with the server. From just looking at the menu, there were a few standouts that I simply needed to try. \n\nAfter the antipasti- we moved on to multiple rounds of pasta. Mamma mia! The swiss chard gnocchi with brown butter was one of the most exquisite things I've ever eaten in my entire life. The gnocchi melted in my mouth as the flavor of the brown butter sauce lingered. This was served with the tortellini with truffle sauce that would've been a knockout on its own. I received the mafaldini with lamb shank ragu as my second pasta course. This was my must-have, and while delicious, the gnocchi still takes the cake. Special shout out to the delectable seafood in the tonnarelli al Frutti di mare that I sampled for one of the other plates\n\nAt this point in the meal, I was starting to hurt, however there was no looking back. No food down, no food left behind. Of course, I had to sample the next round of bread that came out- the sourdough. No regrets either. \n\nI rallied in time for our secondi; in my case, the milk fed veal with asparagus- yet another standout from my initial menu review. I've said this before about veal, however, we have a new winner. This was the BEST veal I've had in my life. We had two different preparations of this tender, tender meat. One was more tender and filet-like, the other was delectably fattier with a slight crisp. There was a dollop of sauce, however I preferred the veal in its own juices. \n\nFinally, we reached dessert status. Based on our groups eagerness to try everything, our server ended up bringing us one of each dessert option. The pistachio flan was placed in front of me, and the pistachio that oozed out of the flan upon dipping my fork was a highlight. We literally based the plates around the table and it was great to try a little of everything. I hit crazy status when the little pastry tray was placed in the center. Did I need to try one of everything? Probably not, but when at Vetri, you try to eat it all. \n\nWhile the food was phenomenal, the staff added to the entire experience. Aside from our fantastic server, the team work and collaboration of guest service was apparent. We had so many people interacting with us throughout the meal that were aiming to please and perfectly harmonized with the actions of their colleagues. \n\nI was smiling on the outside and smiling on the inside. This meal is a true highlight in my culinary life.  So, I'm so thrilled the world isn't ending and I'm not dying.

As a Fairmount/Art Museum resident, I am happy to have you here. \n\nMy friend and I were lucky enough to snag a spot on the official opening weekend. I've heard that they don't take reservations so we really did luck out getting a seat. Our next stop was Wanderlust down at the Piazza and the fact that we were able to casually dine in our yoga gear wasn't a problem. \n\nWe both ordered the Arugula salad, although I was originally leaning towards the Italian Caesar Salad. Based on the recommendation from the couple next to us and affirmation that the Arugula salad could be prepared without olives, I was sold on the Arugula. Upon bringing out my friend's salad, they had forgotten to prepare mine without the olives. The olives seemed pretty big and unobtrusive so I said it would be okay to leave the olives. Our server was on top of it and already sent mine back. The error was handled seamlessly and with grace. The salad was delicious and I was happy it was prepared to-order after all. I never would have thought that potatoes would go well in a salad, but they worked out quite well. The pesto was more oil based- as in not clumpy as a pesto can be- and made for an excellent dressing. Although not listed on the menu, the small chunks of Parmesan cheese made for a great addition. \n\nOn to the pizza...\n\nMy friend and I had ordered one Margherita pie to split since we didn't want to fill up too much before yoga. She had originally debated on getting the Tonno pie however decided against it. This must have confused our server and we were a little confused ourselves when a Tonno pie showed up at our table. As this was an error on their end, we were able to keep the Tonno pie at no charge- score! Another issue handled with grace and professionalism. Ultimately, I did like the Tonno pizza a little better than the Margherita. I figured it would be best to start with the \"basic\" pizza and expand my repertoire from there. The Margherita was a little too simple. Don't get me wrong, simple is not a bad thing. The crust was light, flaky and baked to perfection, the basil was fresh and the cheese was melted perfectly. It just wasn't a life changing experience. The Tonno had that same great crust, but was just a little more exciting. \n\nAs many have already pointed out, the space is small and you are sitting at communal tables. Since this is a pizza joint with a casual atmosphere, I'm okay with that. Next time I'd love to sit by the window seats, complete with a view of Philadelphia skyline. \n\nThe service was fab and we even got to see Mr. Marc Vetri himself hard at work.

Our third course could either be dessert or a choice of two alcoholic beverages. I was planning on having a drink anyways so I went with the Grand Royal as my third course. Doing some quick math, it was like getting a drink for free with my dinner. \n\nWith five in the group, it made sense to try each of the five appetizers being offered: cold sesame noodles, dumplings in chili oil, dan dan noodles, spicy crispy cucumbers and Sichuan pickled veggies. The dan dan noodles are everything people say they are, and easily were a group favorite. The cucumbers were served cold and were a very refreshing savory dish. The cold sesame noodles were also great. The pickled veggies were probably the least favorite of the selection. According to the menu, they were at spice level 10 on a 1 to 10 scale. I was ready to totally underestimate the spice scale at that point. I probably could have also walked away from the table full and gone home happy. \n\nDespite the vast array of appetizers ordered, each member of my party went with a variation of the Dry Pot.

It was still delicious though! \n\nThe only thing restaurant week-esq was the service. Our server was friendly, but not really attentive. The place was by no-means packed either. We were told that there would be a gap between our appetizers and entrees but then 2 out of 5 entrees came out early. A few of us also asked for clean plates for the entrees. It was an odd time during the meal because we still were working on our appetizers but also had our entrees. One of the staff members brought me a new plate and took away my appetizer plate that I told her I was still eating off of. My husband was able to retain his until he finished shortly after. \n\nHaving only dined at the Manayunk Han Dynasty, I was impressed by the open and lofty atmosphere. It was spacious and modern looking. \n\nService aside, we really enjoyed our overall experience. And since it was Dining Days, I'm not going to hold it against them.

Luckily we made last call for food at Mac's Tavern before the kitchen closed for the night. \n\nSo Mac's is nothing like Paddy's Pub in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It's a lot classier of a joint, although it is pretty cool that it's partly owned by the show's stars, Rob and Kaitlin McElhenney. Despite not being Paddy's Pub, it is a really chill pub to grab a drink.\n\nLast night was my first foray into their menu. On Monday nights they have a special on fish tacos that is $2 off the menu price. The majority of my group jumped on the fish taco boat. The fish tacos were really awesome.  The platter came with four large pieces of tempura battered tilapia and the pieces to put together your own taco which included soft tortilla shells, guacamole, cheese, pico de gallo, peppers and a chipotle mayo sauce. This was the biggest portion of fish tacos I've seen in a while and tasty to boot. It was fun getting to put together the tacos myself. \n\nSo my only gripe was the service.

My one friend sat there with an empty water glass for the majority of the meal and didn't even get the opportunity to ask the server for more. Had the server/bartender stopped by more frequently, we probably would have ordered more beers in addition to more water. The kitchen may have closed shortly after we received our food, but the bar was certainly open still.\n\nOn the topic of beers, I thought the draft list was pretty cool. The beers were eclectic, but simple at the same time. The breweries they carried were off the beaten path, but with classic beer styles. I had the Citrus & Piney by the Hop Concept. I've never heard of this Cali brewery before, but enjoy a familiar tasting imperial/double IPA. \n\nUltimately, I'm giving Mac's Tavern a 3-star review.

The food was fabulous as was the service, drinks and atmosphere. There's no reason they don't deserve this 5.\n\nMy husband and I arrived a little before our reservation to check out happy hour. We sat at the bar and were able to enjoy a few of their delicious margaritas. They don't use mixes and you can taste the fresh squeezed lime. They were strong, but you couldn't tell. \n\nSo we got the Groupon deal that others have mentioned. It includes a shared guacamole, shared flatbread, choice of two entrees and shared dessert. They were so very kind as to let us do a little menu modification. Rather than the shared flatbread, we opted for our own guacamoles, which excited me since I could try it with ingredients my husband doesn't like.\n\nWait, ingredients in guacamole? Yep, you get to customize it. I opted for Spanish onion, raw garlic, cilantro, jalapeno, crab and goat cheese. It was heavenly! It was so creamy, and it had the perfect balance between tasting the individual ingredients and being well blended. The chips were light and crispy with a nice amount of saltiness. \n\nFor our entrees, my husband and I decided to share the braised short rib and Pollo Fritto. I'm honestly not fan of ordering chicken out, but the Yelp reviews swayed us in the direction of the Pollo Fritto. Do yourself a flavor and get it. It was lightly fried chicken was very packed with flavor. The skin and meat were delectable. The short rib was also top notch and I would have been raving more about it, if the Pollo Fritto wasn't so darn good. Amazing, amazing, amazing. The sides were delicious as well. \n\nThe meal came with a chocolate sponge cake soaked in triple chocolate cream with whipped cream and coco power. It was plated with a big \"X\" for Xochtil on it.

With the exception of the main course, you didn't get an option. For the main course you could choose between a Malbec or a Chardonnay. The wines were enjoyable and on point with each course. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we also had top notch service.

It was fruity and enjoyable. \n\nThe space wasn't overly big. Expect something more like a taproom rather than a warehouse brewery. It was pretty cramped due to the grand opening, but would probably be fairly comfortable with a regular traffic flow. I didn't try any food off the brewpub menu since it was so crazy during the opening, but I'd certainly come back. \n\nThere are some talks of Brewerytown becoming the next Fishtown, so hopefully with a new and exciting cornerstone to the neighborhood, it is on its way.

The salad could have been better though (but maybe i'm just a sucker for salads of Olive Garden variety). \n\nThe only thing the menu lacks is a decent beer selection. There are a few good ones, but let's see some drafts or a few more bottles on there! Ended up going with the house wine, which sufficed.

My expectations were lowered immensely and I prepared to be waiting for my food for a long time, I almost warmed the oven to have it ready for late cold pizza delivery. However, the pizza arrived in less than 30 minutes. Let's start with the Crust. The crust is your standard mass produced pizza crust. You know the kind, it is semi soft, rarely crunchy and has a lattice imprint on the underside of the crust.  The sauce, well, if there is one thing I cannot say about the sauce, is that it's bland. This sauce is exploding with flavor. Think of a delicate sanmarzano crushed tomato sauce with a bit of fresh basil and imagine an extremly highly seasoned viscious tomato sauce that is so thick, salted, and spicy that it resembles a marinara sauce. It is packed with flavor... although I don't know if it's a very desirable flavor. Lastly is the cheese and pepperoni. This is where they messed up. The pepperoni is great, it's a nice dark greasy beef pepperoni that curls and crisps on the edges while having a molten pool of rich olive oil in the center. The cheese however is a very low moisture mozzarella with a low fat content, it's a very dehydrated cheese and cheaper pizza places will often use it because it has double to triple the shelf life of fresh mozzarella. The problem is that because the sauce is so high in salt and because the cheese is so low in moisture, the liquid released from the cheese upon melting in the oven cannot dilute the salt content from the sauce and the surface stays intact and dehydrated. So the cheese doesn't meld into the sauce it forms a raft that slides off the pie when the delivery driver is making right turns on yellow lights. Where if they used a higher fat and higher moisture mozzarella, it would have melted very evenly at a much lower temperature. This is the type of cheese that we see when we see a pizza slice being lifted from the pie and the cheese stretches out off the slice and down to the cheese magma below. What's worse is that the cheese they use ends up not just being tightly attached in a raft, but when bite into the cheese it has a bouncy firmness to it that turns very solid when the pizza cools down for a few minutes after you open the box. It's a struggle to get a slice of pizza out of the box without all the cheese sliding off or ripping all of the cheese off from the neighbor slices. It's not a bad pizza for midnight delivery, but when you have low quality ingredients, save the deliciously perfect pepperoni, you end up with a low quality pizza, and thats exactly what this is. 1 star pizza, 1 star for the pepperoni, and one star for fast delivery!

If you're prepared to stand awkwardly around the door and outside of this place, or shoved tightly into the inside watching them make your pizza, Pizza City is for you. \n\nThe service was also not so great.

Bartenders and servers also wear full aprons, as if they're prepared to step behind the butcher counter and break down a lamb or pig at any moment. An open kitchen and windowed butcher fridge give the place an expansive and accessible feel.  There is also another bar and classroom upstairs that have not officially opened yet.\n\nWe sat at the downstairs bar across from the butcher counter and ogled the variety of meats offered while ordering drinks. KQ offers a select choice of drafts, cocktails and wines. While perusing the menu I saw a whole pig get brought in, wrapped in paper, put down on the butcher block and start getting broken down.  If you are not a meat-eater, I hazard to guess this sort of ambience is not your thing and would recommend sitting in the back seating area (but I personally thought it was neat!).  Non-meat offerings are available as the menu is divided into \"small plates,\" \"starches, grains, greens,\" and \"entrees.\"   But like the carnivores that we are, we were there to get some tasty animal flesh!\n\nWe stuck to the small plates menu so we could try a few different things.  Here's what we sampled:\n\n - Maitake Mushroom - the mushrooms were served two ways: as part of a puff pastry that included carmelized onion, and lightly sautéed on a bed of mixed greens with a blue cheese garnish both crumbled and as a sauce on the side. The tart was light and airy and worked well with the subtle blue cheese (gorgonzola dolce I believe) sauce. The whole mushrooms were sautéed to perfection, with the ends having a nice crispy texture. The meatiness of the maitake paired with the crumbled blue cheese and mixed greens and was umami-heaven.\n\n- Rare Beef - [Beef sourced from Wyebrook farm in Honey Brook, PA and Perry County Land & Cattle in New Port, PA]  Rare is not an understatement! With only a slight sear on the outer edges, this reminded me of a tartar but sliced into thin strips instead of finely chopped. Served on top of toasted sourdough and a bed or arugula and dressed very simply with a subtle hint of horseradish, parsley and lemon, the flavors were bright and really allowed the beef to stand out as extremely fresh and flavorful.\n\n- Lamb Ravioli - [Grass fed Lamb sourced from Double Brook farm in Hopewell, NJ] This was a special not on the regular menu, and I'm so glad we chose it as it was by far our favorite dish of the night. Lamb meat and lamb liver were combined into a light and airy mousse within the pasta, tossed in a brown butter reduction and rosemary and topped with aged goat cheese. Seriously all I can say is WOW. This was like a flavor bomb exploded in my mouth! The layers of richness and texture, the strong slightly bitter taste of the aged goat cheese shavings, the soft texture of the pasta combined with the nutty brown butter, and the decadent velvety metallic tang of the liver and meat mousse was just pure perfection. I'm not sure how long this special will be available but I'm deploring you to get it while you can, or better yet KQ, add this to your menu!\n\nOur bartenders were attentive and extremely helpful and kind. We were full on the 3 small plates items but I would like to go back again and try an entrée next time.  KQ is a bit pricy; I wouldn't be able to afford going here all the time but I was extremely satisfied with the portions we received for the price.

Each entree comes with a garlic knot and a salad, or soup (go with the soup!), and I can promise you that if you eat your side soup/salad before the entree first will have enough left over for a complete second meal.\n\nMaybe italian isn't your thing, no worries, just order a hoagie or a chicken Caesar Salad (choose the salad!) and prepare to be blown away. My fiancee and I made the mistake of getting a grilled chicken Caesar for each of us once and immediately regretted our decision due to how big they were. One salad can EASILY feed two people (with leftovers) and if they put less than two chicken breasts on top I'd be surprised. The lettuce was crisp, the vegetables flavorful, the cheese was freshly grated, and the chicken was perfectly marinated.

For example, tonight I had the privilege to sit in the third row in the 111 Section (thanks to my fiance's company) and I actually commented to her that even though they were far and away the best seats we've ever had in our 30+ game history together, I still wouldn't pay extra for them because I felt the same way I felt in our usual ground level outfield seats.

Also, their regular \"stadium food\" is so perfect that it's not hard to see why people are willing to wait in line for almost an hour (like 1/3 of a baseball game) to get some. While overpriced, as all sporting event concessions are, their cheeseteaks are phenomenal (avoid the places run by local restaurants, they'll gouge you even more and the quality is just the same as the \"stadium run\" places), their hot dogs and Italian sausages are plump, juicy, and flavorful, plus they make a mean batch of Old Bay fries (or \"Crab Fries\" as they are locally known).\n\nCitizens Bank Park is exceptionally clean for a sports stadium and the layout of everything is perfect (sensing a theme yet?). Concession stands are placed throughout the stadium in a manner that allows for there to be a little bit of everything within no longer than a one minute walk from you seat, and bathrooms are also just a prevalent. \n\nTo cut this long story short, if you're a fan of sports, good times, or good food,  you absolutely must visit Citizens Bank Park at least once in your life, you'll thank me later!", "p": ["Stadiums & Arenas"], "n": []}, {"business_id": "Xq-8-I0U8Artr7d70SjX-g", "name": "30th Street Station", "date": "2012-08-02 22:07:09", "stars": 5.0, "text": "Not only is 30th Street Station the best station in all of Philadelphia it's also probably one of the most elegant buildings in the entire city as well.

First of all, it has exploded with popularity. Dinner service, even at 5pm, is extremely popular. It has become a trendy place to see and be seen in the uber-chic neighborhood of Northern Liberties. \n\nThe second observation is directly tied to the first- the outstanding food. No wonder El Camino has drawn rave reviews and grown exponentially since my first taste; the food is magnificent. Without a touch of pretense, the menu reflects both Tex Mex and authentic Mexican cuisine. It is extensive and has options for both the picky and adventurous, the carnivore and vegetarian, the glutton and the lush. \n\nMay I point out that the Fried Pickle Chips are heaven-sent? I sometimes catch myself daydreaming about them at nite. The crisp vinegary crunch of the pickles, the savory, molten hot breading, and of course, the spicy, smooth, simply decadent chipolte mayo dip served on the side makes my mouth water.

Just to name a few, I love the Texas cheesesteak, the pork bellies, the chili and the enchiladas.  \n\nFurthermore, El Camino distinguishes itself in decor as well. It isn't overly oozing faux authenticity the way that the Cantina begs to (for real, you use flour tortillas, so let's not pretend this is actually South of the Border, ok??) and yet still satisfies the exotic taste inherent to Tex-Mex.

The Good Dog. \n\nThere is a lot to love about the Good Dog. Go to other reviews to hear about the great beer, the great environment and cool menu. You wont be disappointed. However, to me, the Good Dog will always represent one thing: The Burger Renaissance.  \n\nThe Good Dog is the place I first understood what a burger could be. That it could truly ascend beyond its modest ingredients. That it could be more than simply the sum of its part. Yes, it was The Good Dog which taught me that there are no rules with a burger, that it could be bigger, better and indeed bolder than the boring burgers I grew up with in Jersey. \n\nThe Good Dog was my go-to bar after I turned 21. Friday nite, I would get all done up with my roomies, call a cab and head there. At first, i thought it was just a nice spot with good beers. Only after a number of trips did I decide to even look at the menu. Up and down, I peered the interesting items. I decided to go with my favorite comfort food, the classic burger. \n\nIt seems quaint to say it now that gourmet burgers dominate literally every menu in the city, but wow, this burger truly changed the way I thought of it. The bitter cheese, the hearty meat, the sweet onions. It was so simple, yet so perfect. Biting into the medium rare meat, the juice literally drips down the jaw. Un-effing-real. \n\nNow, maybe this is hyperbole, or maybe I am simply a glutton far too obsessed with food, but I can tell you kind reader- without a hint of inauthenticity-   that enjoying this burger completely changed my outlook not just on burgers but in fact food in general. To that point I cooked easy meals and thought of food as fuel. \n\nA lot of people say \"Eat to live, dont live to eat.\" I propose that those people have never eaten a Good Dog burger.", "p": ["Burgers", "Bars", "Restaurants"], "n": []}]}

We were sitting at a long table that was shared with other guests, and the couple who had been sitting next to us left.

I'm somewhere in between the folks who had food orgasms with every bite and folks who felt a little disappointed.  70% of everything we ate was exceptional.  What wasn't is a matter of personal taste and could easily be managed in a couple of ways.  Note that you do receive an evening's menu at the beginning of the meal--you can flag anything that doesn't sound good and more important can ask for particular dishes.  I recommend doing this.  \n\nWe asked to be surprised and this can go two ways depending on the restaurant, you can get something that's totally 'out of the box' or you might get something that many people aren't choosing on a particular night and the kitchen wants to push it out.  For our main protein, I ended up w. goat and it was way too smoky, maybe even a slight error in the execution, hard to say.  It was a but unpleasant, could have used another flavor or two to offset the smoke.  My friend had a small, very thin ribeye and thought there was so much sauce that it overwhelmed the meat.  Best practice would have been for us to send both dishes back and I'm certain the kitchen would have replaced them with something more appealing to us.  I realized this after the fact.  The pasta w. wild boar was gamey to me-but what did I expect. A boar wanders around the forest, getting in fights, snorting and eating bark--it's gonna taste gamey.  My friend traded dishes and he liked the boar.  \n\nDesserts were excellent, but a small plate of tiny cookies afterward was a head scratcher, not particularly tasty or fresh. \n\nWe chose the more expensive wine pairing and this was a highlight.  All of the wines were well matched to the food and the sommelier gives a basic history of how the wine was produced and what to expect when tasting, After the first two courses, I asked for no more white wine and they accommodated. The descriptions get a bit silly after awhile, \"This next wine is from grapes hand picked by Armenian/Swedish nuns in the South of Italy and then rolled across limestone for seventy four days, then dragged up the mountainside by children with severe overbites\" They honestly could have been making half of it up and I would not have known any better.  I circled two of the reds when we received our copies of the menu and wines at the end of the night and will order a bottle of each from a distributor--really striking and unusual. \n\nI'd like to see more vegetables on the menu which seem to disappear after the first appetizer.  This would add more texture to the dishes and some more interesting flavors.  Noticed that there's one sauce made of brown butter that showed up at least three times, maybe a bit of overkill.  While mostly absolutely delicious, and perfectly cooked, the dishes weren't particularly complex in flavor, Vetri seems slightly dated when looking at what chefs are producing these days.  The restaurant is still totally on top of its game in all respects, I just see slight room for improvement/updating w. some minor tweaks.  \n\nWith all that said, there were many, many, amazing bites that made our mouths pop.

Pork dumplings were very doughy, flavorful, but not all the dough heated enough to have any crispness, so again, something in the cooking technique was lacking.  Han Dynasty in Old City is genuinely unique Chinese food, because of the heat, fresh ingredients, and because of the excellence in prep.  Han Dynasty in West Phila felt like an average meal at PF Changs, but one w. tons of spice.  The best part of the experience was the staff, they were extremely nice.  At the end of my meal, I went to the restroom, when I came back, my table was completely bare--no water, no napkin, and I had had almost 1/2 a bowl of Dan Dan noodles left.  Luckily I wasn't planning to take home any of the leftovers and was full.  I had left my bag and coat on the chair, so even a perfunctory glance at the table would have told the busser not to clear the table.  I told the waitress when she brought the check and she said she had already spoken to the busser.  It wasn't a big deal.  I think a more experienced staff might have comped something to make amends.  If I had still been hungry, I would have just insisted that the waiter bring a new order of Dan Dan noodles, I would have done this in a nice way.

So, the point is: ahhhh spread out a little. It's the same delicious vegan fast food stylins and salads from your original HipCityVeg; now with more leg room. \n\nAlso, here's another thing, a sidenote to all this limited seating talk. I love the hell outta that udon salad, but I'm one of these people who seem to take forever to eat a damn salad. I have felt much anxiety, self-consciously imagining that those waiting to score my seat are hissing at me in their minds, \"Jeeeeezus, just will this one just take it to go already.\" Neuroses. So you understand what I'm saying. You can at salads at your leisure, or enjoy sweet potato fries and crispy, crispy nuggets at their peak crispiness. Or both. Makes such a difference, I tell you: a lil extra space and maximum crispiness.\n\nSpeaking of making a difference- when they take the time to griddle a little char onto that seitan in the udon salad, I love that. It really gives the protein that grilly somethin somethin. I love it that this arrugula-y salad it's an actual greens-packed salad with noodles in it, rather than, you know, a bigg asss noodle bowl with some greens fluttered lightly in.

It's a huge, easily splitable, thinly-pounded paillard, topped with tomato sauce and cheesy bubblin from the oven. That was the winner.

We chose the pasta, of course. I wouldn't have taken such issue with the fact that it was a bit overcooked, a touch past the point al dente, but it's just that it was watery too. Arghh, not drained all the way. The tomato sauce and spaghetti suffered this way. Ah well. Maybe if I returned again, I'd go with the sauteed escarole instead.

Ok, here you go:\n\nAfter living in the neighborhood all these years we finally went to Ralph's. I only mention this proximity factoid cause after walking by this historic Italian restaurant roughly a thousand times, I never would have guessed that the place has three levels of dining inside. I completely thought that the intimate tile walled dining room decorated with many black and white family photos, reflecting Ralph's over-a-century long tradition, was the little Italian restaurant in its entirety. Wrong again, ole gal.\n\nWe were seated on the first floor, right in the door, and and kept seeing this steady stream of waddlingly full diners emerging from the back somewhere, carrying bags of leftovers. Where are all these people comin from? That clue and overhearing a waiter tell another patron about the other two floors of dining explained things. Ah ha.\n\nThen why were we seated right on top of this other couple? Rubbin' elbows, like. I really think that we threw them off. Our presence either stopped their conversation immediately, or they were just the type to eat dinner in stony silence. Ah, I kinda felt sorry about it, ya know? They're all mid ravioli, they have the entire right half of the dining room to themselves...and then us. I wonder if it felt like  for them that odd moment where you're sitting on the subway in a virtually empty car with ample open seats a-plenty and some weirdo plops down right next to you. Why oh whyyyy...\n\n Of course I could've requested that we be moved, but then I didn't know if maybe a busload of people had reservations or whatever. Also I didn't want to make the ravioli couple feel like we were repulsed by them or something. Anyway, any of my own awkward feelings subsided soon as our menus were presented to us and I immediately lose focus on everything else except what we're going to be ordering. \n\nRalph's Restaurant is the oldest Italian restaurant (still owned by the same family) in the country. I read on the paper placemat of Ralph's history that President Theodore Roosevelt even may have stopped in for a meal one time. Ravioli couple was then treated to hearing my musings as to what ole rough-ridin' trust-bustin' Teddy might have ordered from Ralph's in his day.

My plan was to get a regular eye exam, and then to use my vision insurance to buy (or more likely subsidize) a pair of glasses. \n\nMy SO made an appointment for directly after me so we went together at around 3PM on a Sunday. We filled out a few forms when we got in, and then we browsed glasses for the 10 minutes it took for the Optometrist(? or Optician?) to see us. After a quick exam and more eyeglass browsing, I realized that $150 towards glasses is somehow not enough (how is that not enough?!) \n\nWe decided that instead of buying $300 glasses that we felt were medium, we would both go to warby parker to buy glasses. WHICH MEANS that I finally have to get contacts (and also have to do the contact exam). The contact exam is extra which is fine, but what felt not so fine is that if you've never had contacts before, they ask you to take a \"class\" that costs something in the $80 ball park. Basically they teach you how to put the contacts in. \n\nI wasn't feeling the $80 for a lesson in how to put a contact in. I think the woman at the front desk got that, so she told me that if you can put it in yourself then you won't have to take the class. The idea is that after your contact exam the eye doctor will give you a pair of contacts (to test out). You have to be able to put in the contacts before they can send you home with more. I think that makes some sense. \n\nI got a quick lesson from my SO (purely theoretical/miming) and then took the contact exam. When it was time to put my contact in I struggled. The eye doctor was great about it though and said he'd have someone give me a quick lesson (for free) and then give me ten minutes or so to see if I could put it in (meanwhile, he'd do someone else's test). After this guy gives me a quick lesson, I get a mirror and start on attempt number 1, when my SO walks over (apparently they sent him over to help). \n\nAnyway long story shorter (notice that I didn't say short, as clearly this was not a concise story) I get the contacts in, am not charged for the \"class,\" and I walk away with 3 months worth of 1 a days for $150. \n\nThat was the long way of saying that the staff are nice and they also do eye/contact exams....", "p": [], "n": []}, {"business_id": "qjGS_7iaQDpbVhS6W8qkHQ", "name": "The Sweet Life Bakeshop", "date": "2016-05-13 12:55:11", "stars": 5.0, "text": "Such good banana pudding.

The 50 mins goes by in a flash.  Every muscle in your body will hurt, but it makes you feel like a rockstar.

I was looking to try out new colored contacts and Paige was very patient with me as I tried nearly all the colors they had to offer!  Despite me trying all of the different colors, the associate worked efficiently that the whole appointment lasted less than 30 minutes.  Also, they told me it would take 3-5 business days for my contacts to come in and it came in 2!

I really enjoyed the appetizers (dumplings in chili oil) and the entree (garlic chicken).  I know, I know, I was looking for noodles and ended up without.  I think this was mostly because as I was looking at the menu, plates kept going by me, steaming of fresh, Chinese wok flavors. I couldn't resist but to try a little of this and a little of that.\n\nMeal was hot, fresh, flavorful and an excellent recommendation.\n\nOn a down side, as I have noticed on this trip, the customer service, servers, waiters don't seem too excited to be working.

Amada was not around when I lived in Philly, so it was new to me, and I was very impressed with the first visit.  The menu looks intimidating at first with many categories - chaucuterie and cheese, traditional tapas, salads, grilled items, and cosas or flatbread.  A good strategy is to try something from each category.  We started with chaucuterie and ordered a large plate of lomo, which was a generous portion for $9.  The ensalada de jamon was another winner -  a fig and cabrales cheese salad wrapped in serrano ham, which was very flavorful and also generous in portion.  For some reason, some of the traditional tapas fell short, like the gambas al ajillo, which was not very flavorful.  But the octopus with potato was incredibly flavorful and tender.  Also not to be missed are the cocas (flatbread) and the version we liked best included duck confit, cabrales, Serrano ham and a date glaze.  Like the salad, just an incredible combination of flavors.  We somehow managed to save room for dessert, and the special was an item that the chef prepared on Iron Chef America, which included small cubes of various melon glazed with sugar (like crème burlee) accompanied by crème fraiche ice cream, which was a lighter and perfect ending to a glorious meal.  Overall, Amada is refreshing new take on an old formula with many surprises.  Highly recommended!", "p": ["Spanish", "Restaurants", "Tapas Bars", "Iberian"], "n": []}]}
